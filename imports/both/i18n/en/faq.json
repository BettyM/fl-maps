Actually you'd be amazed how many people living on the streets have a smart phone as people often donate their old phones to charities and shelters, and they all know where to find wifi<br />Public libraries and shelters are normally spaces with computers and wifi. They are warm and comfortable so people without a home often spend time there<br />It’s also possible to print our maps and hand them out on the streets or at a shelter as an invaluable guide to where to go to meet all your basic needs<br />Of course you could always use the map to arrange an ‘old phone’ collection and give-away yourself, and also arrange a with some local cafes to allow people who are homeless to drop them off for charging when needed"
