      "text" : "This platform is the home of The Public Happiness Movement. It was built by the Focallocal Community as their new home, but we opened the doors and expanding the vision when we realised the great need for all groups working towards a similar positive change, to combine our energies, and to escape pay to play social media. Now we have a platform where a truly global Movement for positive change, connection and peace to grow and sweep the world. Sometimes you will find a page not updated yet, it would be helpful to post a link to it in the community forum"

      "heading" : "Why is the focus on local action?",
      "text" : "Our mission is to empower you and your local community to create positive change yourselves. We do this by sharing the best ideas from around the world, and giving everyone the tools needed improve life where they live. Our platform connects local people who want to take action. This approach teaches people and communities that they have the power to tackle their own issues. There are international projects planned on our platform, but its always intended that local people who understand the cultural situation are the ones who carry them out. Of course, there are many excellent projects for those wanting to directly help those in need overseas, it just isnt what we are doing here. p.s. if thats what you are looking for you should research criticisms carefully as there is a growing awareness that voluntourism often harms, rather than helps communities in need"

      "heading" : "Why not just use Facebook?",
      "text" : "Social media made these kinds of projects possible. It offered a free tool where ideas could emerge from the crowds and some people began using that tool to expore their power to build communities and movements and create a positive difference in the world. Then Facebook, Youtube, Instagram, etc, took that free platform away, switching to a pay to play model for community builders and crushing the newly forming Public Happiness Movement. That and farming you for personal data to sell to marketing firms, or hacking elections around the world. Its time to break up with them. This platform is Opensource and will never collect, or sell your data to anyone. Ever."

      "heading" : "I suggested a project about Gender/Race/Sexuality/Age inequalities, and people told me it was against the Community Values",
      "text" : "You absolutely can create a project to target improving all of those issues, they just need to be carefully thought out to fit with Community Value number 2: An Open Human Space where we treat all humans as equal. This means activities should avoid highlighting differences, and instead focus on promoting and celebrating our shared humanity because our differences are superficial when compared to similarities in the human experience we share. Experienced members in the forums should be able to guide you into how to shape your idea to fit if you want to create it on our platform"

      "text" : "In a way, yes. We are building this to be a project where its members are all the owners. The more energy you put into growing and supporting the ecosystem, the more of the project you own. This is a gradual process that we are building towards, and you will begin to see it more and more as the community grows. Are you the boss.. well yes, we all are. Have a great day boss"
