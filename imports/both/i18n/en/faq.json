      "text" : "Much like a site offering ride sharing, or couch surfing, users give feedback on the experience they had interacting with other users. Someone feeling vulnerable can/should choose to interact with the many users who’ve already earned trust within the community. We recommend posting public meeting places, especially for newer users. Active members are invited to become Community Leaders who are available to offer guidance, and to encourage the growth of an aware and close-knit local community who will quickly spot anything that looks out of the ordinary and bring it to the attention of everyone"

People just coming together to create positive change, so there are no wages to pay and very few outgoings. Founder Andy has supported all Public Happiness projects like this one financially since 2012, which he affords by living in a van and spending money from freelancing on bringing more peace and well-being into the world. We try to get most things, like hosting, etc, free from companies corporate social responsibility fund, and recently as we grew and costs went up, a few community members have also begun chipping in to share the costs around"
