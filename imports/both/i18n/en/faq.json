      "text" : "Our mission is to empower people and their community to create change for themselves. We do this by sharing the best ideas our community has to create positive change where you live, and connecting local people who want to take action and make them happen. This teaches people and communities that they have the power to tackle issues where they live. There are international projects planned on our platform, but it's always local people who carry them out. Ofcourse there are excellent projects for those wanting to directly help those in need overseas, that isn't our mission (if its one of these you are looking for you should first look into criticisms of them as there are many voluntourism projects and charities asking for donations, which cultivate a culture of victimhood and corruption rather than empowering those in need)"

      "text" : "You absolutely can create a project to target improving all of those issues, they just need to be carefully thought out to fit with our Community Value number 2: An Open Human Space where we treat all humans as equal. This means activities should avoid highlighting differences, and should instead be focused on promoting how superficial those differences are when compared to our shared humanity. More experienced members in the forums should be able to guide you into how to shape your idea to fit if you want to create it on our platform"
