It so often seems to have a negative effect on people and society. \  \n \  \nThe crypto-world has me intensely curious, because money can be different. I wanted to learn more and see if it's possible to make a form of money that was intrinsically tied to creating societal value.  Something like a band-aid on 'profit at all costs' capitalism that has blind-spots on large areas critical to a healthy, happy society, due to their foundations measuring success as maximising GDP. Anything which doesn't is by design an after-thought.  \n  \n**Intro:**  \n  \nIf the right people get behind this it will have a profound effect on increasing peace, happiness and reducing human-suffering across the world. If you're reading this it because someone believes that you have the skills to contribute and passion for creating positive change for humanity. \  \n \  \n'Those who love peace must learn to organize as effectively as those who love war'  - Martin Luther King.  \n  \nNote: The paper is very long. The most effective way to contribute is to read the intro, and then click the sections you would most like to contribute to in the contents, and discuss suggestions by clicking the red balloons.  \n  \n**The world needs this Token and Platform because:**  \n  \n  \n  \n1. Our 'profit at all cost' GDP based economy has failed to provide healthy communities to live in and has damaged our planet. It has borrowed from its children's wealth, creating nations where entire generations are largely unable to own a home and a work/life balance pressured against basic human norms like starting a family.  \n  \n    We provide a balancing effect, where people are rewarded for doing essential work needed to produce healthy and happy communities are rewarded.  \n  \n2. Decentralised Governance in blockchain suffers because players can utilise fiat to buy influence over the eco-system's direction and decision making; or centralised founders hold onto power. Undermining the decentralised goals they were founded upon.  \n  \n    We create reputation weighted governance earned through contributions to the eco-system's mission; also opening our governance model up to people outside of the fin-tech community  \n  \n3. Volunteers by nature normally contribute a little, then move on. Leaving most volunteer projects constantly training new team members, at the heavy expense of efficiency.   \n  \n    We incentivise and increasingly reward long-term commitment to positive action for creating a better life on this planet, and to our Public Happiness community itself.  \n  \n4. Those with beautiful and inspirational ideas for creating a change to benefit humanity lose far, far too much energy chasing funding so they can bring it to the world. Far too many of these ideas falter and fade out at the bitter expense of every human alive, because they lacked the skills and connections to fund bringing their vision to life.   \n  \n    If their idea convinces the rest of the community on our platform their vision will be funded, shaped, and built in our micro-volunteering hub, by other community members who want to gift it to the world.  \n  \n5. Social media gave humanity a powerful new tool to collaborate around action in ways never before possible. Where creative ideas and solutions could emerge freely and grow into large scale social events and projects. Then, gradually, they took this tool away. Making it ever more difficult for those ideas to reach an audience unless they were well funded. Big business, celebrity and big charities began dominating reach in a 'pay to play' system while grassroots leaders and ideas struggled and we extinguished. Led by Facebook they cultivated a 'click and move on' culture, educating much of the world's population to ever shorter attention spans, as more clicks, faster equals more and as revenue. Then they began listening to our conversations online, and offline. Collecting our location data. Extrapolating and creating data sets of our most personal details to sell to the highest bidder. They facilitated election hacking to undermine our democracies for their own financial benefits.   \n  \n    Enough is enough! Our platform returns this tool to everyone, regardless of financial backing. It brings back that ability for social movements to form freely, without huge budgets. It pushes back against this consumer culture, leading every member to become active in participatory projects and activities, and therefore empowering us to realise, again, the power we all have when uniting in mass around creative ideas for positive change. It is 100% open source, collecting and selling no personal data, other than what users want to share.  \n  \n6. There is an entire emerging industry, hidden and stifled. Rarely picked up by the media, because these not-for-profit projects can't afford to 'pay-to-play'. Yet individually it's leaders are mobilising hundreds of thousands of people each year into action to meet society's need for increasing peace, community and human connection, understanding, kindness, and well-being. None of those things are recognised, or measured in capitalist, GDP, based societies; and so it goes under the radar. It's leaders living in poverty in order to try and meet society's unmet needs - it's rising stars are often faced with a choice of eating or quitting. This platform creates a 'Happiness Economy' rewarding anyone creating societal value, and benefitting our lives in unconventional, non-profit ways.   \n  \n    This platform allows this emerging economy to take off, opening the door for thousands, perhaps millions, to join in and improve societal well-being. An economy open to anyone, not just the most stubborn and driven.   \n  \n7. The Public Happiness Movement is fragmented. The community's aiming to bring around a global shift in culture towards more peace, connection and well-being, mostly do so in their own space. Each pushing to create the same change.  \n  \n    This platform combines and focuses each community's energy. Magnifying massively our combined message, amplifying our media, audience and activities. This platform allows that energy to stack, and multiply, unleashing an unstoppable wave as a Movement for kindness, individual and community empowerment to solve the issues they face, and human connection. Collaborations and information sharing also becomes easier, as the individual dreams become a shared goal that can be reached.  \n  \n8. The Blockchain revolution is coming, but it remains inaccessible to the vast majority of the public. Those engaging in this new technology rarely come from outside the fin-tech, or investor/speculator sectors. It is boxed off by the technical skills and interest needed to understand it. It's a revolution that is only scratching the surface.   \n  \n    Our Token and Platform take Blockchain onto the streets to engage and interact with people in their everyday life, all across the world. It provides a gentle onramp to understand the world of Blockchain and Cryptocurrency requiring no special technical skills at all in the beginning. It is a desperately needed bridge to open the Blockchain community up to the wider world and begin teaching how it can impact their lives, and will shape our future.  \n  \n9. Greedy startup founders are enriching themselves massively through ICO's, before, and unfortunately regularly, in place of actually building a useful project, and whales owning significant percentages of their total tokens.  \n  \n    Our project is a non-profit with our core team's reimbursement decided by outside adjudication firm. It is against our user terms for anyone to own more than 0.5% of our total released tokens, and if an individual is discovered to have done so they will be advised to sell part, or lose it. In a decentralised economy no-one individual should own more than that amount. There will be no pre-sale to angel investors  \n  \n10. In a time and age where climate change is our 'cold war', with over 70% of our planets bio-mass lost over 20 years, we are facing down the barrel of potentially cataclysmic times. That certain Cryptocurrencies use more energy in mining than entire medium sized nations, is perhaps the biggest issue the industry faces. A global explosion in the industry would be damaging, perhaps even devastating to the world we live in, leading to heavy and needed regulation on the industry. This critical issue must be solved before that inevitable growth occurs.  \n  \n    (Check figures here)  \n  \n  \n     Our Token is pre-mined and then gradually released to create liquidity. The platform will be moved onto the DAPPS network when it scales, not requiring servers. Our proof-of-work is a conceptual construct which users perform mostly in the real world, rather than by performing power hungry mathematical problems on their computers/mining rigs. The Token is built upon Ethereum and will benefit from the upcoming change to Proof of Stake. Our project and token is designed to consume less power than most standard website of similar scale.  \n  \n11. Dangerous messages are being amplified on other media platforms, and used to divide communities for political aims, or to increase profits. Important movements for equality and respect for our shared human experience are being diverted and used to attack each other and drive a wedge in our communities. Misinformation is everywhere. Volume has come to be seen as equal to expertise by far too many people.  \n  \n    We create an energetic space where all activities focus on what unites us as human beings, and are rooted in the peer reviewed science to direct action by the best of current human understanding.  \n  \n12. Many high profile projects and platforms, with multi-billion dollar market caps, average utterly embarrassing numbers of users daily, weekly, or monthly. It's like a dirty secret we aren't supposed to talk about.  \n  \n    The platform you are here to read about onboards existing communities of hundreds of thousands of people, offering them far more effective tools to pursue their positive missions.   \n  \n  \nThis paper is an early non-technical outline of how this could work. If you're reading this and agree with what I've written so far, then you are invited to become a partner, or advisor, and help shape what follows into a polished white paper ready for the world to see. \  \n \  \nWelcome into my dream of a brighter future for our global and local communities,   \n  \nFounder, Andy Tulett  \n  \n(probably move the paragraphs below into a separate 'background' document or article.  \n  \nOur team of volunteers has been building a platform for over 2 years now. The platform is for groups from around the world, anyone who is using positive actions to promote peace and wellbeing through building human and community connection. It's providius a space for our individual networks to grow into something larger. A global movement for a world with more peace and happiness in it. We've reached the point where it is ready to begin hosting communities who will contribute to it governance and improving the platform. You can take a look here: [focallocal.org ](https://focallocal.org) \  \n \  \nIn my 6 years leading a volunteer based Public Happiness community, i've seen thousands of beautiful ideas flicker to life. All but the most stubborn have been extinguished, and those like myself who have refused to give up have struggled financially to manage the massive time commitments needed, because our current society simply doesn't value efforts to unite people and communities. Connected communities are empowered to solve issues afflicting them, and protected from voices trying to divide us for their own selfish (usually political) ends. Those working to unite are providing an essential service to a healthy local, and global community.  \n  \nThe platform makes it far easier for new people to join in, reach like-minded people and explore their ideas to  create more peace and happiness in the world around them. Providing tokens as the financial reward that their energy put towards creating a healthier more connected community deserves, and more support to stop so many of those ideas for positive change from being snuffed out.  \  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \  \n  \n  \n  \n## **Where its coming from:**  \n  \nThis project is an extension of work which i've made my vocation for the past 6 years. Creating a small positive cultural shift to encourage people to take positive action for increasing well-being within their own local communities, and sharing ideas globally on effective ways to achieve that.  \n  \nRejecting the stresses the current economic system places on most genuinely altruistic projects I chose against setting up as a charity and instead to live in a van, or tent for 90% of that period so i could afford to work full-time solely on promoting the concept of people uniting to target improving well-being in their communities.  \n  \nAlways it's felt like swimming upstream against the reality of modern life. People love the idea, but almost all are too pressured to give their time consistently for very long. This Token intends to incentivise their positive action, making it possible to focus on improving local issues and supercharging our network effect to bring crowds into targeting increasing well-being, on a local and global scale. \  \n \  \nHave a look through our [Community Values](https://news.focallocal.org/the-focallocal-community-values/) if you'd like more of the spirit of the project  \n  \nMyself and volunteers in the Focallocal community have been working hard to bring the platform to a minimal usable level capable of supporting the community who will evolve it to fit their needs as we gradually implement a decentralised governance system ..at which point all of us will own this project.  \n  \nWelcome to my dream of a kinder more connected future.  \  \nI hope you'll join in building it to brighten lives, and this world we all live in,  \n  \nAndy  \n  \nNow onto the whitepaper!  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n# Overview  \n  \n  \n## ** \  \nFocallocal Token:  \  \nA New Cryptocurrency Intrinsically tied to Creating Societal Good**  \n  \nFocallocal Token is a currency which is intrinsically tied to creating social good. The more its traded, mined and earned, the more our network benefits local communities around the world, building a friendlier, safer and happier future.   \n  \n  \n## ** \  \nProblems the Focallocal Token Aims to Solve:**  \n  \n  \n### Positive Societal and Cultural Change:  \n  \nSupercharging the network effect of the Public Happiness Movement. Rapidly growing the community through an incentivised ecosystem, directing energy into finding more effective ways to achieve positive societal and cultural change, ideas that we can't even imagine yet – but can't wait to see!   \n  \n  \n### Currencies that benefit Communities: \  \nCryptocurrencies give us the ability to choose to use/support a currency because we agree with its ethical value and effects on society. Focallocal Token aims to demonstrate this to the public by creating an alternative currency with its value distinctly and inseparably tied to positive impacts towards a healthier society where its used and mined.  \n  \n  \n###  \  \nHuman Well-being:  \n  \nOur crypto-enhanced ecosystem directs energy and creativity onto solving issues critical to a healthy local and global society, incentivising action on issues that reduce human well-being which are largely overlooked by today's GDP based societies.  \n  \nDistribution:  \  \nOur Public Happiness activities and projects get people onto the streets reaching people in their daily life and engaging a much wider and more diversified audience into the world of blockchain. Our token is a big step forwards in mass-adoption outside of the current crypto markets.   \n  \n  \n### Educating the Public:  \  \nWe demonstrate how cryptocurrencies can impact people's daily lives and communities in a positive way, and teach them how they can engage with it. Using our network and platform we will lead new users on a journey of discovery, culminating in a greater understanding of the world of blockchain and decentralisation.  \n  \n  \n### Decentralised Governance: \  \nOur platform creates a decentralised self-governing and evolving community focused on positive cultural change. Grandfathering in a reputation weighted community voting system and gradually opening up all areas of the project to decentralised governance, while maintaining a clear direction by guiding members to weigh all decisions against a [Community Values ](https://news.focallocal.org/the-focallocal-community-values/)statement which all users agree to upon joining the community.   \n  \n \  \nOur ecosystem and mission rewards positive behaviour towards each other and society with a higher influence on voting, ensuring a governance culture rooted in that positivity which is resistant to attempts to subvert the token/original mission; as has befallen other decentralised projects.  \n  \n  \n# Further Concepts for Pitch Deck  \n  \n  \n  \n1. Tokenizing massively accelerates the effects of a network. Happiness is a great candidate for the boost a crypto-economic model can provide. Tokenizing will rapidly advance our community's effect on global public happiness and well-being  \n2. Focallocal Token incentivises action and brings users focus onto resolving local issues through taking coordinated local action – local action for global change  \n3. The platform is being built to a minimum usable product. After that users will build it themselves, voting on the best plans to improve it.   \n4. Our ICO will be used to fund top-level staff to bring their skills in and lead the platforms 1<sup>st</sup> users to facilitate a smooth growth, until the community is mature enough to self-govern.  \n5. Teaching users core concepts of the crypto-economic model, our token can operate as a bridge between blockchain and other parts of the non-digital world, through its ability to reach a far broader, and less tech-savvy audience than other coins and tokens. Our platform aims to educate users as to how blockchain will change the world they live in, and how they can understand and interact with it  \n6. Attracting a wider community and an ecosystem to create positive societal change we can't even imagine yet.  \n7. An important step towards organising a healthy and happy society through through decentralised organisation; where those working towards a healthy community are incentivised incorruptible, non-human rewards  \n  \nThe paper below is a working first draft, intended to explain the direction and ethos of the Focallocal Token to the experts joining the project to apply expertise from their specialist area and create a Whitepaper ready for public release. It is currently word heavy and technical expertise light, you're here to improve that.  \n  \n  \n# Contents:  \n  \n1. Abstract  \n  \n 1.1. Background  \n  \n 1.2.

Questions to be Resolved \  \n  \n  \n Focallocal Token \  \nWhite Paper \  \n  \n  \n \  \n**Suggested Names** \  \n~~ \  \n~~PrjH  \n  \n \  \n1.1.  \n  \n**Background**  \n  \nToday's society is based on GDP, with every political decision being weighed against it to see if it can go ahead. The founder of GDP, Simon Kuznets campaigned against its use as a primary tool, arguing that it was never intended to be the base our societies were built upon. He designed GDP in 1937 solely for the post war recovery and believed it was entirely unsuitable as the main measure of societal success/well-being because it undervalued and ignored large areas that are critical to a healthy, functioning society.  \  \n \  \n_'the welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income as defined by the GDP'_ - Simon Kuznets \  \n \  \nThe Charity model exists largely to paper over these cracks, but has rarely been able to resolve a serious societal issue fuelled by using GDP as the primary measure of success. Consider the issue of homelessness, where a vast amounts of money have been donated to charities doing excellent work supporting those who have become homeless over the past 80 years... yet people are still living on the streets in every major city in the World. GDP has a painfully obvious blind spot here which the charity model is unable to resolve. Our nations are getting ever more wealthy and yet people still freeze on the streets.  \n  \nCrypto-economics is the golden opportunity to redress these economic imbalances and blind-spots, preventing the hurt and misery they've caused to so many people across the world all these years from continuing.   \  \n \  \nThe Focallocal Token aims to be a pillar in beginning that essential re-balance by incentivizing action globally, and locally; to identify to resolve these critical and overlooked areas essential to a healthy society – and by doing so on a individual level, bypassing slow moving Governmental process.  \n  \n_'We need to move beyond Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as our main measure of progress and fashion a sustainable development index that puts people first'_ - at the time UN Secretary General, Ban Ki Moon \  \n  \n  \n \  \n1.2.** \  \nFocallocal Token Introduction **  \n  \nFocallocal Token is an ERC20 Token created from Ethereum blockchain. The Token itself will have few modifications, with its value to society, and for trading, coming from its unique use in engaging users in activities and projects to create a happier, safer and friendlier society for their local community. \  \n \  \nAll Public Action is organised via our platform focallocal.org and app. Our web-based platform has been built entirely by volunteers who support the vision and is already operational in Beta, early-launch stage.  \  \n \  \nIntegration of an ERC20 Token into the platform will fuel a rapidly growing community, using the platform and ecosystem to create projects and activities to bring positive change into the world that we can't even imagine yet! \  \n \  \nThe Focallocal Token can be 'mined' by using our platform to take action on local societal issues to create greater well-being nearby. Action which occurs in the real world, is tracked through hash-tagging photos and videos on social media, and via feedback from other users.  \  \n \  \nThe Token is also mined by taking actions essential to the smooth functioning, and growth of the platform, crypto-economic network, and community (for example, bounty hunting issues, or completing micro-volunteering tasks to build projects). \  \n \  \nFounder Andy has always built the Focallocal project based upon people rather than money, because of the negative effect its presence and pressures often have on people, and societies. Choosing to live an extremely frugal lifestyle in order to focus full-time on Public Happiness; living in a van and working side jobs where needed to support it rather than applying for funding or running crowd-funders. The Focallocal Community was built and maintained for 6 years almost entirely on the concept of avoiding money wherever possible.  \  \n \  \nBlockchain creates a new and intriguing possibility to super-charge our positive impact by creating a currency which is intrinsically linked to creating individual, and societal well-being; bringing more peace and happiness to the world each and every time it is used. Focallocal Token aims to be that currency.  \n  \n \  \n**Disclaimer: **Please note that this white paper does not create any legally binding obligations, it is presented here purely for informational purposes. For more information please read our terms of use \  \n \  \n[Add link for terms of use]  \n  \nProblem Statement  \n  \n2.1.  \  \n**Issues we aim to solve**  \n  \n  \n  \n1. Apathy towards issues troubling our society  \n2. Empowering individuals through education on how powerful we can all can be in creating change when uniting together around a creative and effective plan  \n3. Exploring and sharing the most innovative and effective ideas to create progressive societal change from across the world and incentivising people in recreating them   \n4. Giving everyone an opportunity to use their time, passion and know-how to create a better world, through globally coordinated localised action  \n  \n2.2. \  \n**Primary Goal \  \n**We live under a system which rewards actions which advance our society's economic output, but largely ignores our societal well-being outside of that narrow spectrum. It increasingly pressurises humanity to focus on what advances GDP, leaving important work in the community for charities, and councils to try and patch over.  \  \n \  \nWe strongly believe that societal, and individual well-being should be treated as an equal, or even higher priority in our global society than economic. Focallocal Token's main goal is to provide people with an incentive to unite and work together in making their local community a happier, safer and friendlier place by tackling social issues that reduce well-being like homelessness, loneliness, crime rates, isolation, etc. \  \n \  \n \  \n2.3.  \n  \n**Secondary Goal**  \n  \nThis project also aims to empower ordinary, people regardless of their technological ability, to become fluent in cryptocurrency transactions, smart contracts and distributed ledger technology. Through their interactions with our platform and the Focallocal Token they will gain an entry point of understanding of blockchain, the potential uses for blockchain technology, and its ability to transform society and the world they live in by building a world where creating social good is as important as manufacturing or banking. Their understanding of the fiat currencies they use daily will also be forever changed. \  \n  \n  \n2.4.  \n  \n**Relation to Universal Basic Income**  \n  \nUniversal Basic Income is another concept which has the potential to create societies where many people use their increased freedom to focus on and tackle societal issues.  \  \nIt's a sad situation when people want to do things to make their local community a better place to live, but feel too busy or too stressed about work. A situation Universal Basic Income has the potential to solve, yet UBI faces many hurdles to become accepted policy in all nations. It is likely to be a long and bumpy road and its implementation is likely to differ widely. Focallocal Token can be considered as a step on the same path, and one which compliments UBI beautifully by incentivizing those living in societies who adopt it to utilize some of that increased freedom to focus on improving life where they live.  \  \n  \n  \n \  \n  \n  \nEducating the Public about Blockchain  \n  \n3.1.  \  \n**Current State of Public Understanding** \  \nThe general public's current understanding of cryptocurrency is overwhelmingly narrow. Most have heard of Bitcoin and understand it's something like an alternative currency to Fiat. The narrative pushed by the news is rarely about the multitude of exciting technologies being built upon blockchain and smart contracts, or the ethos of decentralisation which crypto-economics was founded upon. which will shape the future of our society.  They might have heard something about a hack, Ethereum, or perhaps something about some cyber-kitties ..most people simply don't really understand what all the fuss is about as it's not a recognisable part of their world yet. \  \n \  \n3.2. \  \n**Reaching a New Audience** \  \nFocallocal Token reaches an entirely new audience, as well as taking our token onto the streets to interact with the wider public and positively impact their daily lives. We aim to use this as an opportunity to introduce more people, across all different areas of society to an understanding of the basics of blockchain technology, that it has real world uses, and how it can impact the world they live in.  \n  \nWe intend to offer: \  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n*   An open platform which guides users on a journey from absolute beginners, to workable understanding of blockchain technology and how to interact with it.  \n*   The opportunity to earn (mine), own, trade and understand our token and crypto-economic network.  \n*   Introducing people to the idea that they can now choose alternatives to Fiat currencies (£,$,E) to support by adopting and using – demonstrated through the ability to use a currency which is intrinsically linked to creating societal good, Focallocal Token.  \n*   Guiding users to create a wallet, transfer tokens to an exchange, and trade for fiat or other cryptocurrencies. Teaching users good practices for cold storage  \n*   Teaching users to spot scam tokens and those which run against the principles of decentralisation  \n  \n \  \nOur team firmly believes the future of our society will be built on the blockchain. Right now public perception and understanding is extremely limited outside of a narrow tech-minded segment. Focallocal Token aims to take a highly visibility and engaging token out onto the streets all across the world, reaching the lives of the general public with blockchain technology in a way that has never been done before. \  \n  \n  \nUsers of our platform's 1<sup>st</sup> step to owning a cryptocurrency will via the world they already understand - public events, project building and social media - rather than purchasing on an exchange, which is difficult for those with less interest in tech or financial markets. We will then guide them to a more complete understanding.  \n  \nThe Focallocal Token  \n  \n4.1. \  \n**Token Overview** \  \n7.6 Billion Focallocal Tokens will be created as a new ERC20 token from the Ethereum Blockchain, this amount is fixed and will never change. In theory every human alive could hold one each. It's a nice thought anyway, and signals our intention of being decentralised and taking every effort to avoid whales owning large percentages of our token \  \n \  \nPeople new to blockchain can find the numbers of decimal places a challenge to grasp initially. Starting with a high number of tokens and low decimal limit of 4, we will make that 1<sup>st</sup> step a little easier for newcomers, whilst still taking a small step from the standard two decimal integer of Fiat currencies.** \  \n**  \n  \nFocallocal Token is given value through its initial ICO, later trading of the token on stock exchanges, and the ability to use it in place of Fiat currencies in the real world (either through creating partnerships with businesses, or guiding users onto token switching payments solutions)  \n  \n'Mining' Focallocal Token is a process of earning it through agreed behaviours which increase happiness and well-being in the users local community, or performing tasks essential to running, or building our network and community.  \n  \nThis mining process means that the currency is naturally deflationary as set amounts are automatically released from our treasury. Initially we anticipate this deflation to be offset by a rapidly increasing value due to a low starting market cap, and later the number of tokens owned will probably make this deflationary force negligible.  \n  \nMining is built on real world action, creating a soft upper limit on how much can realistically be earned. This is designed in a way that minimises the risk of token centralisation.   \n  \nOur token is immutable, and will create a permanent record of the effort everyone has put into improve life in their local community. \  \n  \n  \nFocallocal Token ICO   \n  \n5.1. \  \n**ICO Strategy** \  \n \  \nTo raise funds to build/improve our network a portion of tokens will be sold off in an initial coin offering.  \n  \nMany tokens limit their early sales to a small group of large investors, creating centralised tokens which are easily, and often manipulated by their wealthy 'whale' investors to game the system and increase their wealth, this also leads to a centralised collection of the wealth, something fundamentally against the ethos blockchain technology was founded upon.  \  \n \  \nICO's have also become a hotbed for scams, junk tokens, and projects that have no need to be on blockchain at all. To avoid being in that category and to create a token which is widely and evenly distributed amongst both those engaged in crypto, and new people who haven't yet engaged in the blockchain revolution, we will hold an ICO spread across three stages, limiting initial investments allowed per person and using platforms easily accessible to a wide audience, regardless of previous exposure to cryptocurrencies. \  \n \  \nThere will be no pre-sale to big time investors. Guaranteed opportunities for everyone to get involved, and every possible effort made to prevent whales from eating up large amounts of our token and undermining the decentralised mission on this project.  \n  \n**5.2. ICO Stages**  \n  \nStage 1:   \n  \nInvestors will have 30 days to register an Ethereum address through the Civic app. Once the ICO opens, registered investors will be capped initially at 1 ETH that can be invested in the first 24 hours. This way, everyone that registers has 24 hours to get in, and the token should be decentralised among a wide crowd rather than being owned by a few big whales.  \  \n \  \nStage 2:   \n  \nThis stage will be held on a crowdfunding website to reach those who don't understand how to join in a traditional ICO. Investors will be rewarded set amounts for donating at increasing intervals. The top threshold of reward for donations will be set at 1 ETH per user. Users may choose to invest more to support the project, but will not receive more tokens than stated. \  \n \  \nStage 3:   \n  \nMidway through the crowd funder the top limit will be raised to 1.5 ETH, and the traditional ICO will be reopened for a second round with a limit of 2 ETH, users may invest up to the respective limit on all of the platforms concurrently \  \n \  \nEmail addresses will not be collected to prevent issues as seen in the Bee Token phishing scams which plagued their ICO  \n  \n**5.3. Ongoing Funding for Specific Projects and Experts**  \n  \nInitially specialists will be employed to lead development in each area. As the community matures the allocation of funds will be opened up fully to decentralised voting on allocation. Users subscribed to the funding allocation channel will engage in discussion and voting around how to distribute funds released from our vault between issues like:   \n  \n  \n  \n*   specific projects  \n*   platform improvements  \n*   experts to resolve an issue facing the community  \n*   buying back tokens to increase their value  \n  \n \  \nReimbursements:  \n  \nTeam members/tasks reimbursement levels will be determined by a project finance specialist at the 1<sup>st</sup> stage of the decentralisation process - this means that the early community and specialists building it aren't able to vote to give themselves a larger share of the token, as happened recently with the EOS community. This kind of selfish grabbing of resources by the initial team members undermines the decentralised nature, and ability to build a reputation of trust, for any blockchain community.  \n  \n**5.4. ICO Marketing**  \n  \nCrowd-funding: \  \nThe ICO will also be launched via a popular crowdfunding website, where those donating more than certain set amounts will receive a listed amount of Focallocal Tokens as a reward. This makes our ICO more accessible than any before to those with little understanding of Blockchain/Cryptocurrency, by using a format they are more likely to be familiar with. \  \n \  \nThose who purchase Focallocal Tokens via crowdfunding will receive instructions in how to create a crypto wallet account and guide to storing their Focallocal EC20 tokens – Likely the 1<sup>st</sup> steps into understanding how to interact with blockchain for many.  \n  \n \  \n \  \nGifting Focallocal Token:** \  \n**Part of the crowdfunding marketing will have a focus on 'gifting' Focallocal token to friends and relatives, by entering their email and a message for them when donating. Most people have now heard about Cryptocurrencies and are curious, many also still believe it is simply a token, or have no idea what it is. By offering those donating the chance to gift a token which benefits issues in their local community, we introduce a way to tap that curiosity, and encourage learning about why crypto is different to fiat.  \n  \nPublic Happiness Partners: \  \nGroups already taking action for more peace and happiness in this world in a manner that fits with our [Community Values ](https://news.focallocal.org/the-focallocal-community-values/)statement will be invited to super charge their network effect using our ecosystem to fuel more members joining their activities, publicise their activities through using our enhanced tools, and more effective methods to reach their followers via our platform.   \n  \nThey will also then be rewarded financially for their future efforts, and selective excellent projects will be offered tokens backdated for activities and projects they've created over the last ten years to recognise the effort and personal sacrifice that has gone into creating more well-being in GDP based societies which don't reward their efforts, and incentivising them to carry on their great work for everyone's benefit.  \n  \n**Public Happiness – Background**  \n  \n6.1. \  \n**Community Background**  \n  \nFounder Andy worked for the past 6 years building and running a non-profit volunteer community aiming to change the world by bringing people together to give their time voluntarily to solve global issues, on a local scale. Theorising that in many situations charities are massively limited in scale, and an unstoppable wave of change could be created if it became a normal habit to give a few hours a week on resolving issues in our local communities, using the most effective ideas collected from other users around the world (local action for global change).  Creating a proactive and empowered global community who want to meet and adapt these projects to fit their culture and then replicate them to target change to societal issues like homelessness, isolation, human connection, etc,   \  \n \  \nThe past 6 years felt like swimming upstream. Many amazing people came in and did fabulous altruistic work, most were shortly pulled away by other commitments and general modern life pressures preventing momentum from really building - especially in London, the founding city. The struggle was against a world where good intentions are in constant strife against heavy pressure on our free time.  \  \n \  \nBlockchain is a chance to incentivise that action, allowing the modern world to refocus their attention on local issues important to a healthy society, which have been marginalised under our constantly pressured, GDP based societies. Modern technology also allows us to share effective ideas in a far more intelligent way than ever before and achieve a much greater impact than previously possible. \  \n  \n  \n \  \n6.2.  \  \n**The Focallocal Community**  \n  \nSet up as a non-profit charitable organisation in the UK, the Focallocal Community has been established since 2012 as an open volunteer community for people wanting to take action and make the world they live in a happier, safer and friendlier place through creating public happiness activities and projects which reach out a friendly hand to the wider community, and targeting issues which harm public well-being, like homelessness, poverty, isolation.  \  \n \  \nThe community is built on the motto 'Local Action for Global Change' due to the core belief that local people coming together and targeting a societal issue using creative and positive ideas collected from around the world, are far more effective in most situations than outsiders coming and making change for them. They can adapt ideas to fit the local culture, while teaching people how to come together and 'do it ourselves' empowers us all to understand that it is the local community is ours, and together we have the power to shape it into the place we dream of living in. \  \n \  \nActions are always based on positivity. There are times in the world when anger and forceful action is necessary. They are fortunately rare, while action based around a clear goal, plan and built upon positivity often becomes irrepressible. Action that is adaptive, agreeable, and incites more people to follow it becomes impossible to argue against like swimming against a river, with nothing to grab onto eventually there is no other option than to give up and go with the flow.  \n  \nPlatform Overview  \n  \nThe Focallocal platform currently exists as a website located at https://focallocal.org. If you've visited it you've probably noticed it is currently a highly fragmented site/platform. This is intentional, the platform has been built as a 'minimal functional platform' capable of supporting a community who will transform it into an effective  decentralised Public Happiness platform. who will use the tools available to redesign and reshape the platform to better fit their collective needs. \  \n \  \nFocallocal.org, the platform, is also available as an ios and android app.  \  \n \  \n \  \n7.1. \  \n**The 'Public Happiness Map'**  \n  \nAn area of the platform to bring users together to connect and take our project and token to the streets. Users can create and join Public Happiness Gatherings, and find other members nearby. Users can list themselves on the map (in an approximate location for privacy), and select all the public happiness activities they would like to be contacted for, creating a searchable map of people nearby who want to meet and take action bringing more well-being into the world they live in. \  \n \  \nThe Map also allows users to explore approved suggestions for Public Happiness Gatherings, along with;   \n  \n  \n  \n*   Details about the societal issue targeted  \n*   Videos  \n*   How to guides  \n*   Photos of others around the world enjoying that activity  \n*   Peer reviewed studies which support the impact that activity has on society  \n*   Automated pre-generated description from the activity/gathering being run, to partner the user created description and ensure that each activity explains the societal issue being targeted to all users  \n*   Quick share buttons for creating 'events' on other social media platforms, to help build awareness  \n*   Leave 'positive experience' or 'negative experience' feedback on other users to protect from unwanted uses of the platform \  \n  \n  \nFocallocal Tokens will be distributed automatically by our Distribution Matrix amongst those attending, sharing, and the organiser of the gathering.  \n  \nTo receive tokens from taking Public Happiness to the streets users are required to post their photos and videos to social media with the following hashtags:  \n  \n#focallocal #publichappiness #publichappinessmovement #publichappinesstoken #[name of gathering] #[location].  \  \n \  \nThis can be considered 'proof of work' and their posts will be located autonomously and pulled into an easy to view list, to be checked and approved by others in the system, in order to award tokens. Abuse and fraud is monitored by bounty hunters within the community, and a list of hashtags found will be recorded to allow the bounty hunters to review suspicious accounts easily.  \n  \n \  \n7.2. \  \n**The Action Center \  \n**An open micro-volunteering hub, and project management suite where complex projects are broken down into small tasks, or 'Missions' anyone can complete. Each 'Mission' should take a user between 30 mins and one hour, if longer is needed then it needs to be divided into smaller chunks.  \n  \nOur system of breaking tasks into smaller parts removes one of the biggest problems faced by volunteer communities – well meaning people offering to complete large tasks and not following through, often leading projects to fail as others wait and wait, momentum is lost, and as frustration grows it leads to other volunteers giving up and dropping out also.   \n  \nIn the Action Center users select a due date within the next two weeks when 'accepting a mission' (assigning themselves a task). If they miss that target the Mission returns to the 'to do list' for others to claim and complete preventing projects being held up by well meaning, but unreliable people as is common in traditional volunteering and Microvolunteering systems.  \n  \nTokens are distributed for completed tasks, with a two week delay so other users, and moderators can monitor for any abuse of the system.  \n  \nThe Action Center helps users to browse projects, see all the resources available for each, and either find 'Missions', or 'Discuss' the project with others users in our Discourse forum.  \n  \nThe number of currently active global projects is limited to focus attention onto the existing ones.  \n  \nNew ideas for Public Happiness projects can be submitted by any user, to be discussed, improved, and voted onto the platform for others users to join in  \n  \nLocal projects are open for anyone to build/try out where they live, which may require gathering their own team. For this reason local projects can also be posted into the Public Happiness Map. \  \n \  \n \  \n7.3. \  \nCommunity** News (or Happy News)** \  \nA user generated 'Community News' site, open for all to add articles or video links. This incentives users to create, like and share content (articles, photos and videos) to inspire more people to join in the Movement and Platform and creates a user led magazine to increase users sense of community and being part of something bigger, something global. \  \n \  \nAll articles submitted will be checked by experienced users who have accepted an invite to become moderators. Moderators will operate as copywriters with the ability to edit the quality, but not direction/message of content.  \  \n \  \nModerators will mine tokens by approving content. Users will mine tokens either by posting, or sharing content and receiving likes.  \n  \n7.4.  \  \n**The Active Happiness Shop**  \n  \nAn integrated Shopify store selling 'Active Happiness Clothing' which make a small positive change happen in the world around the wearer simply by putting the item on in the mornings. The clothing is an extension of our Public Happiness activities, with most items functioning as a passive way for each public happiness activity to occur outside of organised activities and gatherings. For example, a shirt informing others that the wearer is carrying bubbles, and inviting people around them to blow some. \  \n \  \nMaterials and Public Happiness Action Packs are also available, and users will be encouraged to purchase with their Focallocal Token. Profits will cover basic costs such as hosting, with any excess made available for users to vote on how best to use it in aid of advancing our project and community.  \n  \n \  \n7.5. \  \n**Who defines what is accepted as 'Public Happiness?'**  \n  \nAs users gain experience and rise in ranks on our platform they'll be invited to become admins and review all new project and gathering suggestions against our [Community Values](https://news.focallocal.org/the-focallocal-community-values/). This ensures users will be in control of the direction, but guided by its initial vision.   \n  \n \  \n7.6. \  \n**Evidence Based and Peer Reviewed**  \n  \nWhen users submit a new idea for a project or activity its recommended that they find peer reviewed studies to support the benefits their idea will have on society to promote the concept that all efforts to effect a positive cultural change should be rooted in the best current understanding of available evidence. Users will be guided to place where they are likely to find sources, as we want to build an informed and competent community. Those who are discussing and reviewing it for approval may add more, and an integral part of our ecosystem will be 'Research Bounty-Hunting', were users are rewarded for finding new peer reviewed studies to add to already approved activities, or which lead to the removal of an outdated study.  \n  \n7.7. \  \n**Who can Participate on the Platform**  \n  \nThe platform is open to anyone wanting to create well-being and happiness where they live, or support the Movement. Some users may choose to use it while travelling; being a decentralised network we define 'local' to be where they are at that time, or where they consider home (users are naturally guided towards 'gathering' with local people who understand the local customs and any adaptations necessary). \  \n \  \nThe platform is pre-populated with projects, missions and pre-approved public happiness activities. Users are invited to suggest their own, which will be discussed by other members in the forums to explore potential issues and ways to strengthen the impact of the idea, then reviewed by the community to make sure it aligns with our [Community Values](http://news.focallocal.org/the-focallocal-community-values/), before being approved. Effective ideas for positive action will be incorporated into the platform and recommended to other users to use creating positive cultural change where they live.  \n  \n** \  \n**7.8. \  \n**Pre-existing Communities with Similar Values**  \n  \nGroups and communities already doing excellent work in creating Public Happiness and well-being projects and activities where they live, are all welcomed to use our platform and ecosystem to supercharge their positive impact on society.  \n  \n \  \nTheir existing activities will need to be submitted in the usual way and approved by other network users to check that they conform with our 'Core Values' statement, to ensure the proposed activity meets the chosen definition of a 'Public Happiness' activity or project. This may lead to some groups splitting their usage of our platform with some of their activities approved, and using their existing social media platforms for others which do not fit so well with our [Community Values](https://news.focallocal.org/the-focallocal-community-values/). \  \n  \n  \nPlatform users can 'follow' individuals and groups to keep informed about their activities and projects. \  \n  \n  \n7.9.** \  \nLanguages \  \n**The platform will launch in English, with adding other languages set as an early mission for the community.  \n  \n7.10.  \n  \n**Decentralised Governance and Voting**  \n  \n \  \nEach area and section of the platform will have a discussion forum linked where users can discuss improvements to the operations and design of their community and platform, creating a mass decentralised governance system. \  \n \  \nStage 1: \  \nUsers wanting to raise a vote on a platform or operations change will need to post calling for a vote, and explaining the need. If their post receives likes from 20% of users subscribed to that thread who have been active in the past 6 months, then a vote takes place. The sections forum must have a minimum of 5 members subscribed, otherwise the user will need to encourage people to join it before suggesting a vote.  \n  \nStage 2:  \  \nTwo threads are created in the section, and cross-posted into the forum's voting section for community-wide visibility. One thread for arguments for, and one for arguments against the change.   \n  \nStage 3: \  \nUsers are all welcome to comment their argument in the threads for and against, the threads will be ordered by likes received so the strongest arguments float to the top.  \n  \nStage 4: \  \nAfter reading the topic users can vote on the topic 'for' or 'against' the change, if the 'for' topic receives more than 55% the change is agreed to be implemented.  \  \n \  \nProtection from Brigading:  \  \nUsers votes are weighted based on the reputation they've built by contributing to our project, and bounty hunters are actively seeking to find any subversive coordination and bring it to the attention of the wider community; for more information see Chapter 8. \  \n \  \nLack of Understanding: \  \nUsers aren't all expected to be experts on blockchain or community governance. They will naturally gravitate to areas of their interests and expertise, leading to more people with an understanding on a topic being subscribed to that section when a vote is called. This gives them the 'first mover' advantage to get informed arguments in to give a greater understanding to those joining in from the main voting category in the forum. \  \n \  \n \  \n \  \n  \n  \nThe Path to Decentralisation  \n  \n8.1. \  \n**Benevolent Dictatorship vs Complete Community Governance** \  \n \  \nWe expect platform users/community members who rise to higher rankings through their action to increase well-being in their local community, will be sufficiently invested in the vision of the platform that their greater influence on decision making will create a culture which protects the platform from abuse and actions which run against our Core Values. It would be poor planning not to consider those eventualities in assessing how our platform and community would be impacted, before deciding on how we best to weigh the security risks of complete decentralisation against the importance of introducing our members to the concepts of community governance on the blockchain.  \n  \n8.2. \  \n**Example Scenario: Outside Collusion \  \n**A significantly sized outside group infiltrate our platform, operating as model members, or pretending to and avoiding detection. Once reaching a high enough rank to influence a vote they collude to state that 'watching tv and drinking beer' meets with our Core Values and should be approved as a Public Happiness Activity. \  \n \  \nOr more perhaps more concerningly 'Rallies supporting a religious hard-line political candidate' meet the criteria.  \n  \n8.3. \  \n**Lines of Defence \  \n \  \n**1<sup>st</sup> Line:  \  \nThe culture of a community built from members focused on creating 'social good' will lead those reaching a higher level to be benevolent with their increased influence.  \n  \n2<sup>nd</sup> Line:  \  \nOur 'Bounty Hunting' model incentivises users to find external groups coordinating action outside of the scrutiny of the wider community and bringing them to the attention of the wider community.   \n  \n3<sup>rd</sup> Line:  \  \nTiered Governance Levels will be created. Users joining the platform have already agreed to the core aspects of the community and its vision. Most of that will be open to community voting, while other areas should be protected by the founding members to safeguard from potential attacks and degradation of the initial vision, for example, the Communities Core Values can be influenced by voting calling for a change, but not changed directly.  \n  \n4<sup>th</sup> Line:** **  \  \nIn our terms and conditions we're making it banned for any one person to amass more than 0.5% of our token. Hopefully it's not possible to reach that with the way our token is distributed, as human greed has tainted all major decentralised projects so far, with reports that there are individuals owning more than 1% of both Ethereum and Bitcoin, having a fail safe seems prudent. If it can be proven that one individual (outside of our vault for steady release) owns wallets containing more than 0.5% of all tokens our terms and conditions state that the excess tokens will be deleted.  \n  \nLast Line:**  \  \n**Founder Andy retains a veto vote. Intended never to be used it serves as a last line of defence against subversion of the platform and community away from its core vision. In the case Andy is unable to use it the veto vote will pass to the 3 next (secretly) designated members, determined by his personal judgement on integrity and understanding of the Focallocal Token and Community vision, where 2 out of 3 are required to use a veto.   \n  \n8.4.** \  \nConclusion** \  \nTo meet our goals and teach users the core concepts crypto-economics and blockchain, our community needs to move towards a culture of decentralised decision making, via on-chain governance. Doing so immediately, or fully, would open the platform up to abuse and security risks. For that reason decentralisation will be grandfathered in as the community grows, with the founding team assessing it's current ability to protect itself from abuse while working towards increasing decentralisation, allowing greater community led governance.  \  \n \  \nSome core areas of the project will always remain closed to change via community voting as a final line of defence from abuse, for example, the 'Core Values' which the community is based upon. To trigger a necessary change to these protected areas community members could create a vote to bring attention of the core team and put pressure on them to initiate the change, or to engage in further public discussions.  \n  \nSecurity  \n  \n9.1. \  \n**Levels of Trust** \  \nImplementing levels of trust, where platform users rise in ranks by performing tasks to maintain and grow the Public Happiness network and ecosystem, means that scammers would be receiving a small sum unless they first put in the work beneficial to the community to reach to a higher level. Community voting will maintain this balance between security vs the incentive for new members joining in.  \  \n \  \nA two week holding period before mined tokens are released gives time for bounty hunters and other community members to find and report scams.  \n  \nMiners creating public activities where much of the work is conducted offline will be required to post hashtags on social media of photos and videos taken at their activity as proof of work, which are tracked by our bot, linked to their account, and published in a list of pending tokens earned, making it simple for other users and bounty hunters to check if they think something suspicious is going on (the requirement for posting and hashtags is also fantastic marketing for the community and movement).  \n  \nOut network is designed to make cheating the system more difficult than actually doing the required work. \  \n \  \n \  \n9.2. \  \n**Community Administrators **  \n  \nExperienced members who have contributed to the ecosystem will be invited to become a Community Admin, with extra tools available for supporting other platform users.  \n  \nCommunity Admins will receive tokens for performing critical oversight tasks within the platform, like being alerted to check issues by other members, step in to mitigate disputes, or remove members acting against the spirit required to maintain a positive and effective community.  \n  \n \  \n9.3.** \  \nProject Administrators** \  \nUsers in the Action Center interested in team leading can apply to be a team leader of an existing project, create a new one, or take over an inactive one. Experienced and proactive members in each project will be invited to become an admin of the Public Happiness Projects, by overseeing a board  \n  \nPublic Happiness Missions completed will need to be approved by admins of each board  before rewards are released. Each board can have multiple admins. \  \n  \n  \n9.4.  \  \n**Mining Limits**  \n  \nA hard limit exists on the amount of tokens one user can earn each week, set to a reasonable limit for how many activities or missions one user can realistically complete to prevent a large scale effort to scam the system and limit exposure to small scale scams.  \  \n \  \nThe platform will guide users through creating an off-platform Hot Wallet (to avoid the added risks of holding tokens on our platform) which it will interact with and distribute their earned tokens into. The platform will guide users to manage their personal digital security in the world of blockchain; teaching them how and why to:  \n  \n  \n  \n*   move the tokens into cold storage  \n*   safely back up their seed  \n*   move their tokens to an exchange to trade  \n*   make purchases with their tokens  \n*   send tokens to friends and family (which will double as a good marketing strategy to grow our community)  \n*   create a secure hot wallet and back up their keys safely  \n  \n \  \n9.5 \  \n**Cold Storage and Key Holders \  \n**In our model a large amount of the total Token's created are held for future release creating obvious security concerns, and also safety concerns for our core team. To remove these concerns we will be hiring a company who specialise in crypto security and ask them to ensure keys are split among the team and none of our team is able to access the 'vault' without a set number of others. We will fully automate the release of tokens into the platform. \  \n \  \n \  \n  \n  \nMarketing Strategy  \n  \n10.1.** \  \nHash-tagging \  \n**Requiring hash-tagging as proof of work creates a highly effective method of free marketing. Everyone receiving our token through the Public Happiness Activities side of the platform will also be Hash Tagging about the token, flooding all social media platforms with images and videos of happy people around the world engaging in our Movement to massively boost interest and awareness of Focallocal Token. \  \n \  \nThe proof of work bot will be searching for #Focallocal #PublicHappiness #PublicHappinessMovement #[miners location] #[activity name], and checking the connected social media profile against our database of connected user accounts.  \n  \n \  \n10.2. \  \n**Bus Tour \  \n**A team of our community will be touring in a bus/minibuses and taking Focallocal Token to the streets. Initially beginning with Europe, with other prominent groups invited to tour their continent mirroring the main tour groups actions.  \n  \nOn the tour the team will visit cities, towns and villages and demonstrate how people can earn a Focallocal Token and what impact it can have on life in their local community. We'll be using the teams skills to partner with local groups/charities in related fields and target transforming an issue troubling the local community, like homelessness, loneliness, supporting the elderly, lack of urban green areas and gardens; along with our general Public Happiness activities. \  \n \  \nHow much funding is raised will determine whether we tour in a bus or a fleet of vans and minibuses. The ideal bus would be a 1960's classic British Routemaster, due to the attention it would get outside of the UK boosting our marketing effort. The average price of these is £100,000+. A more likely choice is a Volvo B7TL Double Decker due to their renowned reliability.   \n  \nIf we go with van's a fleet of Mercedes Sprinters will join '[Connie the Connector](https://www.facebook.com/connietheconnector/)' again due to their reliability, and also Andy's experience in repairing them.  [Connie the Connector](https://www.facebook.com/connietheconnector/) was converted by Andy and another community member in 2014 to switch back and forth between regular Diesel and running on Waste Vegetable Oil - leftover cooking oil (WVO). As it is arguably still the greenest form of fuelling a vehicle, all other vehicles will also be converted, giving us the ability to collect from people joining our activities and project in each location, and/or to partner with a major restaurant or hotel chain and collect their left over oils. \  \n \  \n \  \n10.3. \  \n**Video Channel \  \n**The bus tour will be filmed, with regular instalments of life on the road taking Public Happiness and our token into local communities and bringing more happiness and well-being to the world. As a ground-breaking and exciting project we anticipate attracting a large following, especially as it will be supported by all other marketing efforts.  \n  \n10.4. \  \n**Happy Cam \  \n**The project's adopted dog rescue dog will be entering a life full of travel,  happy faces, and fun public events to enjoy. Not only will he/she become a superstar for the cameras, they will also become a video creator with a harness and Gopro mounted, so that viewers can tune in to our Youtube and watch clips of life travelling the world with a community in a bus/van fleet, and creating public happiness, from the perspective of a very happy dog.  \n  \n10.5 \  \n**Public Happiness Partners \  \n**There is already a small movement of active Public Happiness creators around the World, just waiting to spark into life, with many held back by the difficulties of balancing committing so much time towards increasing well-being for their community, against the pressures of needing to be paid for their work in today's world.  \  \n \  \nFounder Andy has been a Public Happiness Activist/Expert for the past 6 years and is connected to the most active of these. They will be offered 'back-pay' for their contributions towards creating a kinder world for us all to live in, and invited to join our platform and use the ecosystem to remove this financial pressure, and to massively increase their network effect. You can also read more details about this in section 5.4. \  \n \  \nNew groups operating for similar goals will be invited to join our ecosystem if they are comfortable operating within our [Community Values](https://news.focallocal.org/the-focallocal-community-values/), and massively boost their good work through our enhanced network effect while also retaining their collective identity.  \n  \nThe percentage earned from each sub-activity when coordinating large scale activities and projects is not subject to the usual weekly limits for tokens earned. \  \n  \n  \n10.6.** \  \nOnline Supporters  \  \n**An open (non-censored) community is active on Reddit at reddit.com/r/focallocal where people can interact with other supporters of the project, and our internal community will communicate through our Discourse forum at [discuss.focallocal.org](https://discuss.focallocal.org/)   \n  \n10.7.** \  \nContests \  \n**Everyone loves giveaways and a strategy of rewarding those most active in promoting our ICO and Token in a series of contest will be created \  \n  \n  \n10.8. \  \n**Collectables \  \n**Collectables will be created for special activities a user joins in, and also landmarks they achieve within our ecosystem. This acts as a fun side game within the platform while giving milestone rewards to users, and using it to introduce the them to collectables and other crypto-economic ideas. The collectables will be characters designed by the community and may feature logos, titles and names of the groups who coordinated large scale activities/projects.** \  \n**  \n  \nAutomated Token Distribution Matrix  \n  \n \  \nThe platform automates rewards for carrying out tasks via our ecosystem which work towards to maintaining and improving its operations, and the mission of creating greater more friendliness, peace and happiness in this world.   \n  \n11.1. \  \n**Weighted Mining \  \n** \  \nLevels of trust:** \  \n**Users will go up in ranks as their total contribution to global happiness increases through our our platform. Each rank receives more tokens for each action on the platform. To reduce the incentive for scamming by making it less rewarding to automate new accounts, and to reward the most active and loyal contributors to the Focallocal Token ecosystem and global happiness mission.  \n  \n** \  \n**Levels of Scale:** \  \n**Some local activities are organised on an International Scale as a coordinated effort to create positive cultural change. Peter Sharp at the Liberators International for example organises a yearly Eye Contact Gathering promoting increased human and societal connection through sharing a minutes eye contact with passers-by to remind us of their shared human experience beyond superficial differences such as age, gender, ethnicity, etc. Last year on one day he mobilised a gathering in over 350 cities around the world, bringing action to the streets for more connected communities at a local level while targeting a global increase in well-being.   \n  \nWhen an activity is tiered in this manner on our site over the course of a few days, the original organiser will receive 20% of the tokens awarded to all the Public Happiness Activities they led and supported. Their core team will also receive a larger share of tokens if they are using the Action Center in our ecosystem to incentivise building and publicising the project.  \n  \n[List of participating cities](https://www.eyecontactexperiment.com/participating-countries) for the 2017 International Eye Contact for Human Connection. \  \n  \n  \nLevels of average cost of living in each country:  \  \nThe token earnings from creating activities or completing project missions will be linked to the current average income in each country, keeping a balanced incentive to join the project across every nation. Taken from a publicly available online source of average cost of living per country.   \n  \nIn special occasions the community may choose to vote on increasing the incentive in a specific country above its cost of living, for example, to offer support during hyperinflation such as Venezuela has recently been experiencing; or perhaps to target a country where few people have joined (obviously this creates an avenue for potential voting abuse and will need to be monitored rigorously until the communities self-governance is mature and pressure tested). \  \n  \n  \n11.2.** \  \nHard Cap \  \n**A hard cap will be set on the amount that any one user can earn each payment period at each user level to minimise the risk from abuse and fraud, and to maintain our vision of Focallocal Token allowing users freedom to reduce their working hours and give time to resolving issues to create and maintain a happier, more connected local community. \  \n \  \nThe percentage earned from each sub-activity when coordinating large scale activities and projects is not subject to the usual weekly hard cap limits for tokens earned, although any obscenely large reward will likely be flagged for discussion by the community before being released. \  \n \  \n11.3. \  \n**Adjusting the Balancing**  \n  \nThe automated weighting and distribution system will apply a set level to the above metrics, which can be adjusted by community voting to find the most efficient balance for maximising our network effect and mirror its evolution.   \n  \n11.4. \  \n**Token Release** \  \nInitially a pre-set amount of tokens will be set to release each week for 100 years, divided between active contributors to the ecosystem and mission. The number of tokens released each week will be set on a graduated incline to balance rewarding early contributors with greater rewards, against the exponential increase of users the token will be divided amongst as the community grows. \  \n \  \nThis weekly token release makes our currency deflationary, which will be offset by increases in value from market trading. \  \n \  \n11.5. \  \n**Mining Table** \  \n \  \n[Provisional table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oufDho2f_jT12ch0ef6wC4yVWTLQClK2t0gxTTvv6fI/edit?usp=sharing) of actions contributing to the ecosystem which users are rewarded for \  \n \  \n11.6. \  \n**Experience Multipliers** \  \nA users total tokens earned/contribution to the ecosystem is recorded and used as a multiplier increasing their tokens earned and also the weight of their votes.  \n  \n  \n  \n*   Beginner Happiness Maker  \n*   Novice Well-being Creator  \n*   Experienced Positivity Activist  \n*   Local  Action Hero  \n*   Public Happiness Legend \  \n  \n  \n11.7.  \  \n**Token Distribution** \  \n50% (4.85 Billion Tokens) will be released during the initial 3 ICO launches and give the token value through trading on exchanges \  \n \  \n10% will be retained to pay for hiring experts to lead the development and marketing of the Token while the community grows its capacity to self-govern, promote and evolve. \  \n \  \n40% will be retained in our vault to be 'mined' by users incentivising public happiness and doing essential work in the ecosystem. \  \n \  \nInitial targeted release time: 100 years  \  \n \  \nThe mining total will include a small amount that will be 'back-paid' to notable communities around the world who have given their time to create Public Happiness projects which fit within our shared Mission, as a thank you for their efforts, and in order to encourage them to join the platform and use it to increase their network effect. This will also include volunteers who gave their time and energy to the Focallocal community, never expecting to be reimbursed. \  \n  \n  \n9.7 Billion \  \n50 % = 4.85b \  \n40% = 3.88b \  \n100 year = 36500 Days \  \nAverage release rate: 265753/day** \  \n \  \n**Release rate will be curved to keep the excitement of getting in early, while not making the tokens worthless when users join in later.  \  \n \  \n11.8. \  \n**Further Matrix Considerations \  \n** \  \nThe matrix needs to consider:  \  \nThe number of active users each week, from 10 to 100,000 to 100,000,000 \  \nThe number of actions per week by a user, plotted between 1, to a high of 400. With the average per user anticipated to be around 20, multiplied by the users experience rating. \  \n \  \nIn charts assessing reward rates tokens should be plotted against different market caps from £10,000 to £100,000,000,000 to show anticipated value of incentive for contributing to our token in Ethereum, Bitcoin, £, $ and E.  \  \n \  \nThe returns are speculative at this point, and we will adjust the points 'mined' for each action as the platform launches to find a nice balance. As the governance progresses on the path to decentralisation, these charts will be interactive and hosted on the platform as a useful visual guide during votes on increasing/decreasing these data points to balance their impact in advancing and maintaining the mission.  \n  \nTeam** **  \n  \nSome roles will be fixed for increased stability and an initial injection of experience and necessary skills. Others will be outsourced to the community via Microvolunteering in the Action Center   \n  \n12.1.** \  \nCurrent Team Members**  \n  \nAndy Tulett: Community and Token Founder \  \nPublic Happiness Expert/Activist since 2012 \  \nDegree in Business and Entrepreneurship from University of Portsmouth \  \n  \n  \n12.2. \  \n**Positions Open**  \n  \n  \n  \n*   Marketing Team  \n*   Automated Token Distribution Systems Engineer/Data Scientists  \n*   Behavioural Analyst  \n*   Community Managers  \n*   Road Trip Coordinator  \n*   ERC20 Experienced Developer to work on integration  \n*   Crypto/Blockchain Expert to work on integrating on-ramp into our platform guiding users to an base understanding of crypto economics   \n*   PR Manager  \n*   Meteor/JavaScript Developers  \n*   API Key Integration Specialist  \n*   Digital Security Expert  \n*   Accounts and Finances Manager  \n*   Youtube/Video Channel Manager  \n*   Crypto/Securities Legal Expert to ensure our token makes every effort to meet all required national and regional laws  \n*   Release Manager  \n  \nRoles will be for a pre-agreed period to invigorate and lead the community as it grows. Once the community reaches maturation all of the above roles will be governed by decentralised members of the community itself who will be rewarded by tokens to an amount the community has agreed on – although hopefully the experts will choose to remain actively involved in the community they were integral in building, due to their previous contributions they will have earned top level user status.** \  \n **  \n  \n12.3. \  \n**Remuneration \  \n**The team of experts will be remunerated 50% in Ethereum, and 50% in Focallocal Tokens with the 1<sup>st</sup> payments coming shortly after the ICO launch and including all work towards the project prior to the ICO .  \n  \n \  \n12.4.** \  \nFacilities \  \n**The team will either operate remotely using our online hub, or work from the road trip which travels to demonstrate to communities how they can use our platform to improve life where they live, aiming to attract new members to the platform and form groups in each location using our ecosystem to work on improving life quality where they live (see Marketing in section 10.2. for more details about the road trip).  \  \n \  \nNot requiring fixed office space will enable us to keep overheads low, adding flexibility and the ability to weather crisis, alongside a sense of adventure matching our global ambitions, to the project.  \n  \nTechnicals  \n  \n13.1.** \  \nCrypto Linking Bridges**  \n  \nPublic Happiness Activities: Meteor Js/React to REST API   \n  \nWell-being Projects (Missions): Web-hooks from Trello (or Wekan)  \n  \n13.2. \  \n**Trello vs Wekan vs Other Solutions**  \n  \nThe Public Happiness projects section in the Action Center is a Micro-volunteering Hub which breaks large projects down into 30 min – 1 hour 'Missions', enabling anyone to join in and help build the project and bring it into the world.  \n  \n \  \nCurrently the system uses Trello as an external platform. This creates a vulnerability where malicious users can damage altruistic projects by moving cards around, or deleting them. As the user-base grows we have scheduled a switch to Wekan, an open-source clone where we can import all of our data, although the community may decide to go in a completely different direction to improve project management on our platform. \  \n \  \n** \  \n**13.3. \  \n**Leaflet.js vs Google Maps API  \  \n**The Public Happiness Gatherings system is currently build using MeteorJS, React and [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/). The map itself is designed by members of our previous (non-incentivised) volunteer community and pulled from Google's API. The Public Happiness Gatherings system can handle 25,000 users each day, giving us a lot of room to develop before we need to assess changes.  \n  \n13.4.** \  \nSwitching the Platform to the Dapps Network  \  \n(Decentralised App)**  \n  \nThe two main areas of our platform, the Map (Public Happiness Gatherings) and the Projects/Micro-volunteering (Missions) are built in Meteor Js* which is ideal for switching to host on Ethereum's Dapp network as it is built using reactive programming. \  \n \  \nThis switch is not guaranteed at this point, but it is a logical step and will be reviewed by the team and community at predetermined steps during the roadmap.  \n  \nDoomsday Protocol  \n  \n \  \nThe Crypto world is highly volatile at this point in time which will lead many projects to overstretch themselves, ending up in trouble if an event outside of their control hits. \  \n \  \n14.1. \  \n**Huge Market Crash \  \n**Focallocal Token is entirely secure from some major news crashing investors confidence in the entire blockchain market. Everything is designed with the ability to fall away, with the platform and community capable of running a skeleton site with near zero outgoings. \  \n \  \nWe achieve this important safety buffer by transferring agreed fees and payments into a separate bank account and crypto wallets immediately upon agreeing an outgoing and preferring short term contracts as a policy, because the ecosystem will be self-sustaining in the future without needing external contracts; meaning all future costs are safely stored away and ready to be paid when agreed. The platform could in theory continue operating with absolutely zero outgoings if we collectively decide to switch to running on the Dapps network. \  \n \  \nThe project already has 6 years of experience demonstrating that people believe in our vision and will continue to use the platform regardless of the value of the Token. Even in the case of a complete market crash where the token became almost worthless for a prolonged period, many users would remain active supporting the mission, and using the platform to deliver greater peace and well-being to the world.  \  \n \  \nFocallocal Token would basically become fancy internet points, with the added benefit that the loyal members, and those giving their time and energy to global happiness purely for altruistic reasons would get to stock up on token and be handsomely rewarded when it rises from the embers of the market crash.   \n  \nAs long as there is a community behind it the Token cannot fail, it will continue to be a positive force in this world regardless of Market conditions. \  \n \  \n \  \n14.2. \  \n**Quantum Security \  \n**To some extent we are tied to advancements in the Ethereum network. There are open pull requests such as pull request #208: Abstraction of transaction origin and signature.md.  \  \n \  \nOn our end our entire system is being reviewed by a quantum security experts, and we will also host bounties and bounty hunting contests for anyone able to find flaws and vulnerabilities in our platform so they can be identified and fixed.  \n  \n14.3. \  \n**Massive Hack** \  \nAs a last resort in the case of a massive attack there is the possibility of a Hard Fork, resetting everything to a time before the hack on the public ledger.  \n  \nOur Tokens value is tied to its positive effect on wider society, raising the possibility of a hard fork at a set point before the hack switching the token used on the platform; isolated from its ability to create societal good the original would become worthless.  \n  \nAll data of tokens earned on the system is held off-site in social media and gathered by our bots, or in provable work contributed by users in the Action Center, Community News Site and Forums. It would be a large task, but all tokens mined fairly between the time of the hack and the fork could be restored. Traded Tokens (outside of lost in the hack) would be visible on the public ledger and proof of ownership could be submitted to gain the new Token.  \  \n \  \nProject contributions in Wekan/Trello can be backed up off-site or recovered from the teams which created the projects. Token earned legitimately after the hack could easily be restored, leaving the thieves with worthless digital residue.  \  \n \  \nThe implications of this option are obviously wide ranging and it would be an absolute last resort in a disaster mitigation strategy, with the case explained to the community before being voted on.  \n  \n14.4.** \  \nZombie Apocalypse ** \  \nIf the inevitable finally occurs, we will convert the Public Happiness Bus into a 'Public Happiness Buoat' and retreat to a small uninhabited Greek island, where our new society will flourish and sparkle as a bastion to all Humanity's greatest achievements by using Focallocal Token to create a paradise where every economic interaction creates more harmony and a closer more caring community, while the rest of the world performs a perfect impression of today's paparazzi for each others brains.  \  \n \  \nIf the community has decided on having a fixed base, for example renovating an abandoned village, before this point it will built using the best off-grid technology today's society has to offer, and be zombie-proofed.  \n  \nGiving Back to Open-source  \n  \n \  \n2% of all funds we raise from the ICO will be donated to support the Open-source ecosystem that drives so much of the innovation we see in the world \  \n \  \n15.1. \  \n**Open Source Projects We Use \  \n**2% will be donated to the following projects we've used in creating our platform, Token, and Movement;  \n  \n  \n  \n*   Discourse  \n*   Vue.js  \n*   Wekan?  \n*   Libre Office  \n*   Free Wordpress Plugins  \n  \n15.2. \  \n**Donations to Notable Other Open-source Projects**  \n  \n1% will be donated to other notable open-source projects which are positive forces within this world, as chosen by our community through voting, for example, Wikipedia.   \  \n \  \nThe vote results will be non-binding, to mitigate against any obvious attempts to cheat the vote by outside groups as the platform and community will not yet be ready to protect itself from coordinated efforts to cheat the vote, without spending an unnecessary amount of energy on securing the voting (it can be used as an early pressure test on the integrity of certain areas of the platform as this type of online contest invariably draws efforts to undermine fair voting).  \n  \nTimeline  \n  \nAgreed Date  \n  \n  \n  \n*   30/7/2018 : 1st draft of the White Paper  \n*      : 2nd draft of the White Paper  \n*      : Witticism, fun and Focallocally flavour added to white paper  \n*      : Technical Details focused heavily around the Distribution Matrix added to the white paper  \n*      : Provisional White Paper posted online to announce our token, and gather feedback for further improvements, and build team.

The token will have no value if people can't trade it so we'll need to be listed on a few before the ICO finishes  \n*   Which other crypto coins/tokens should we include in the platform to introduce our users into the crypto-economic ecosystem, for example, should our videos primarily be  hosted on Lbury? Is their platform ready?  \n*   Should the platform be hosted on the DAPP network?  \n*   Should community governance voting be tokenized/on-chain? Or using our Discourse forum's voting? Security might be better is on-chain  \n*   How can we best compartmentalise voting to prevent overload on users, without pockets of influence forming?   \n  \n    <span style='text-decoration:underline;'>Next Steps</span>  \n  \n*   Set up ICO plan within our Action Center  \n*   Full review of all content on focallocal.org to update content that has become outdated  \n*   Token created  \n*   Full security review of all open-source plugins used in building the website  \n*   Full review of platform UX/UI and tech stack, looking quick ways to make large usability improvements, improving access and scalability.  \n  \n    Thank you for reading, have a wonderful day!  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n");//"# Welcome to the 1st Draft"
