var markdown = md.render("# Public Happiness Movement Whitepaper \n  \n**Foreword:**  \n  \nI've lived about  1: `dcs-1` 2: `dcs-balloon-exp.png` 3: `dcs-balloon-exp` 4: ` `  as frugal a life as is possible in the Western World because I've always disliked money.  It so often seems to have a negative effect on people and society. \  \n \  \nThe crypto-world has me intensely curious, because money can be different. I wanted to endlier, safer and happier future.   \n  \n  \n## ** \  \nProblems the Focallocal Token Aims to Solve:**  \n  \n  \n### Positive ger, something global. \  \n \  \nAll articles submitted will be checked by experienced users who have accepted an invite to become moderators. Moderators will operate as copywriters with the ability to edit the quality, but not direction/message of content.  \  \n \  \nModerators will mine tokens by approving content. Users will mine tokens either by posting, or sharing content and receiving likes.  \n  \n7.4.  \  \n**The Active Happiness Shop**  \n  \nAn integrated Shopify store selling 'Active Happiness Clothing' which make a small positive change happen in the world around the wearer simply by putting the item on in the mornings. The clothing is an extension of our Public Happiness activities, with most items functioning as a passive way for each public happiness activity to occur outside of organised activities and gatherings. For example, a shirt informing others that the wearer is carrying bubbles, and inviting people around them to blow some. \  \n \  \nMaterials and Public Happiness Action Packs are also available, and users will be encouraged to purchase with their Focallocal Token. Profits will cover basic costs such as hosting, with any excess made available for users to vote on how best to use it in aid of advancing our project and community.  \n  \n \  \n7.5. \  \n**Who defines what is accepted as 'Public Happiness?'**  \n  \nAs users gain experience and rise in ranks on our platform they'll be invited to become admins and review all new project and gathering suggestions against our [Community Values](https://news.focallocal.org/the-focallocal-community-values/). This ensures users will be in control of the direction, but guided by its initial vision.   \n  \n \  \n7.6. \  \n**Evidence Based and Peer Reviewed**  \n  \nWhen users submit a new idea for a project or activity its recommended that they find peer reviewed studies to support the benefits their idea will have on society to promote the concept that all efforts to effect a positive cultural change should be rooted in the best current understanding of available evidence. Users will be guided to place where they are likely to find sources, as we want to build an informed and competent community. Those who are discussing and reviewing it for approval may add more, and an integral part of our ecosystem will be 'Research Bounty-Hunting', were users are rewarded for finding new peer reviewed studies to add to already approved activities, or which lead to the removal of an outdated study.  \n  \n7.7. \  \n**Who can Participate on the Platform**  \n  \nThe platform is open to anyone wanting to create well-being and happiness where they live, or support the Movement. Some users may choose to use it while travelling; being a decentralised network we define 'local' to be where they are at that time, or where they consider home (users are naturally guided towards 'gathering' with local people who understand the local customs and any adaptations necessary). \  \n \  \nThe platform is pre-populated with projects, missions and pre-approved public happiness activities. Users are invited to suggest their own, which will be discussed by other members in the forums to explore potential issues and ways to strengthen the impact of the idea, then reviewed by the community to make sure it aligns with our [Community Values](http://news.focallocal.org/the-focallocal-community-values/), before being approved. Effective ideas for positive action will be incorporated into the platform and recommended to other users to use creating positive cultural change where they live.  \n  \n** \  \n**7.8. \  \n**Pre-existing Communities with Similar Values**  \n  \nGroups and communities already doing excellent work in creating Public Happiness and well-being projects and activities where they live, are all welcomed to use our platform and ecosystem to supercharge their positive impact on society.  \n  \n \  \nTheir existing activities will need to be submitted in the usual way and approved by other network users to check that they conform with our 'Core Values' statement, to ensure the proposed activity meets the chosen definition of a 'Public Happiness' activity or project. This may lead to some groups splitting their usage of our platform with some of their activities approved, and using their existing social media platforms for others which do not fit so well with our [Community Values](https://news.focallocal.org/the-focallocal-community-values/). \  \n  \n  \nPlatform users can 'follow' individuals and groups to keep informed about their activities and projects. \  \n  \n  \n7.9.** \  \nLanguages \  \n**The platform will launch in English, with adding other languages set as an early mission for the community.  \n  \n7.10.  \n  \n**Decentralised Governance and Voting**  \n  \n \  \nEach area and section of the platform will have a discussion forum linked where users can discuss improvements to the operations and design of their community and platform, creating a mass decentralised governance system. \  \n \  \nStage 1: \  \nUsers wanting to raise a vote on a platform or operations change will need to post calling for a vote, and explaining the need. If their post receives likes from 20% of users subscribed to that thread who have been active in the past 6 months, then a vote takes place. The sections forum must have a minimum of 5 members subscribed, otherwise the user will need to encourage people to join it before suggesting a vote.  \n  \nStage 2:  \  \nTwo threads are created in the section, and cross-posted into the forum's voting section for community-wide visibility. One thread for arguments for, and one for arguments against the change.   \n  \nStage 3: \  \nUsers are all welcome to comment their argument in the threads for and against, the threads will be ordered by likes received so the strongest arguments float to the top.  \n  \nStage 4: \  \nAfter reading the topic users can vote on the topic 'for' or 'against' the change, if the 'for' topic receives more than 55% the change is agreed to be implemented.  \  \n \  \nProtection from Brigading:  \  \nUsers votes are weighted based on the reputation they've built by contributing to our project, and bounty hunters are actively seeking to find any subversive coordination and bring it to the attention of the wider community; for more information see Chapter 8. \  \n \  \nLack of Understanding: \  \nUsers aren't all expected to be experts on blockchain or community governance. They will naturally gravitate to areas of their interests and expertise, leading to more people with an understanding on a topic being subscribed to that section when a vote is called. This gives them the 'first mover' advantage to get informed arguments in to give a greater understanding to those joining in from the main voting category in the forum. \  \n \  \n \  \n \  \n  \n  \nThe Path to Decentralisation  \n  \n8.1. \  \n**Benevolent Dictatorship vs Complete Community Governance** \  \n \  \nWe expect platform users/community members who rise to higher rankings through their action to increase well-being in their local community, will be sufficiently invested in the vision of the platform that their greater influence on decision making will create a culture which protects the platform from abuse and actions which run against our Core Values. It would be poor planning not to consider those eventualities in assessing how our platform and community would be impacted, before deciding on how we best to weigh the security risks of complete decentralisation against the importance of introducing our members to the concepts of community governance on the blockchain.  \n  \n8.2. \  \n**Example Scenario: Outside Collusion \  \n**A significantly sized outside group infiltrate our platform, operating as model members, or pretending to and avoiding detection. Once reaching a high enough rank to influence a vote they collude to state that 'watching tv and drinking beer' meets with our Core Values and should be approved as a Public Happiness Activity. \  \n \  \nOr more perhaps more concerningly 'Rallies supporting a religious hard-line political candidate' meet the criteria.  \n  \n8.3. \  \n**Lines of Defence \  \n \  \n**1<sup>st</sup> Line:  \  \nThe culture of a community built from members focused on creating 'social good' will lead those reaching a higher level to be benevolent with their increased influence.  \n  \n2<sup>nd</sup> Line:  \  \nOur 'Bounty Hunting' model incentivises users to find external groups coordinating action outside of the scrutiny of the wider community and bringing them to the attention of the wider community.   \n  \n3<sup>rd</sup> Line:  \  \nTiered Governance Levels will be created. Users joining the platform have already agreed to the core aspects of the community and its vision. Most of that will be open to community voting, while other areas should be protected by the founding members to safeguard from potential attacks and degradation of the initial vision, for example, the Communities Core Values can be influenced by voting calling for a change, but not changed directly.  \n  \n4<sup>th</sup> Line:** **  \  \nIn our terms and conditions we're making it banned for any one person to amass more than 0.5% of our token. Hopefully it's not possible to reach that with the way our token is distributed, as human greed has tainted all major decentralised projects so far, with reports that there are individuals owning more than 1% of both Ethereum and Bitcoin, having a fail safe seems prudent. If it can be proven that one individual (outside of our vault for steady release) owns wallets containing more than 0.5% of all tokens our terms and conditions state that the excess tokens will be deleted.  \n  \nLast Line:**  \  \n**Founder Andy retains a veto vote. Intended never to be used it serves as a last line of defence against subversion of the platform and community away from its core vision. In the case Andy is unable to use it the veto vote will pass to the 3 next (secretly) designated members, determined by his personal judgement on integrity and understanding of the Focallocal Token and Community vision, where 2 out of 3 are required to use a veto.   \n  \n8.4.** \  \nConclusion** \  \nTo meet our goals and teach users the core concepts crypto-economics and blockchain, our community needs to move towards a culture of decentralised decision making, via on-chain governance. Doing so immediately, or fully, would open the platform up to abuse and security risks. For that reason decentralisation will be grandfathered in as the community grows, with the founding team assessing it's current ability to protect itself from abuse while working towards increasing decentralisation, allowing greater community led governance.  \  \n \  \nSome core areas of the project will always remain closed to change via community voting as a final line of defence from abuse, for example, the 'Core Values' which the community is based upon. To trigger a necessary change to these protected areas community members could create a vote to bring attention of the core team and put pressure on them to initiate the change, or to engage in further public discussions.  \n  \nSecurity  \n  \n9.1. \  \n**Levels of Trust** \  \nImplementing levels of trust, where platform users rise in ranks by performing tasks to maintain and grow the Public Happiness network and ecosystem, means that scammers would be receiving a small sum unless they first put in the work beneficial to the community to reach to a higher level. Community voting will maintain this balance between security vs the incentive for new members joining in.  \  \n \  \nA two week holding period before mined tokens are released gives time for bounty hunters and other community members to find and report scams.  \n  \nMiners creating public activities where much of the work is conducted offline will be required to post hashtags on social media of photos and videos taken at their activity as proof of work, which are tracked by our bot, linked to their account, and published in a list of pending tokens earned, making it simple for other users and bounty hunters to check if they think something suspicious is going on (the requirement for posting and hashtags is also fantastic marketing for the community and movement).  \n  \nOut network is designed to make cheating the system more difficult than actually doing the required work. \  \n \  \n \  \n9.2. \  \n**Community Administrators **  \n  \nExperienced members who have contributed to the ecosystem will be invited to become a Community Admin, with extra tools available for supporting other platform users.  \n  \nCommunity Admins will receive tokens for performing critical oversight tasks within the platform, like being alerted to check issues by other members, step in to mitigate disputes, or remove members acting against the spirit required to maintain a positive and effective community.  \n  \n \  \n9.3.** \  \nProject Administrators** \  \nUsers in the Action Center interested in team leading can apply to be a team leader of an existing project, create a new one, or take over an inactive one. Experienced and proactive members in each project will be invited to become an admin of the Public Happiness Projects, by overseeing a board  \n  \nPublic Happiness Missions completed will need to be approved by admins of each board  before rewards are released. Each board can have multiple admins. \  \n  \n  \n9.4.  \  \n**Mining Limits**  \n  \nA hard limit exists on the amount of tokens one user can earn each week, set to a reasonable limit for how many activities or missions one user can realistically complete to prevent a large scale effort to scam the system and limit exposure to small scale scams.  \  \n \  \nThe platform will guide users through creating an off-platform Hot Wallet (to avoid the added risks of holding tokens on our platform) which it will interact with and distribute their earned tokens into. The platform will guide users to manage their personal digital security in the world of blockchain; teaching them how and why to:  \n  \n  \n  \n*   move the tokens into cold storage  \n*   safely back up their seed  \n*   move their tokens to an exchange to trade  \n*   make purchases with their tokens  \n*   send tokens to friends and family (which will double as a good marketing strategy to grow our community)  \n*   create a secure hot wallet and back up their keys safely  \n  \n \  \n9.5 \  \n**Cold Storage and Key Holders \  \n**In our model a large amount of the total Token's created are held for future release creating obvious security concerns, and also safety concerns for our core team. To remove these concerns we will be hiring a company who specialise in crypto security and ask them to ensure keys are split among the team and none of our team is able to access the 'vault' without a set number of others. We will fully automate the release of tokens into the platform. \  \n \  \n \  \n  \n  \nMarketing Strategy  \n  \n10.1.** \  \nHash-tagging \  \n**Requiring hash-tagging as proof of work creates a highly effective method of free marketing. Everyone receiving our token through the Public Happiness Activities side of the platform will also be Hash Tagging about the token, flooding all social media platforms with images and videos of happy people around the world engaging in our Movement to massively boost interest and awareness of Focallocal Token. \  \n \  \nThe proof of work bot will be searching for #Focallocal #PublicHappiness #PublicHappinessMovement #[miners location] #[activity name], and checking the connected social media profile against our database of connected user accounts.  \n  \n \  \n10.2. \  \n**Bus Tour \  \n**A team of our community will be touring in a bus/minibuses and taking Focallocal Token to the streets. Initially beginning with Europe, with other prominent groups invited to tour their continent mirroring the main tour groups actions.  \n  \nOn the tour the team will visit cities, towns and villages and demonstrate how people can earn a Focallocal Token and what impact it can have on life in their local community. We'll be using the teams skills to partner with local groups/charities in related fields and target transforming an issue troubling the local community, like homelessness, loneliness, supporting the elderly, lack of urban green areas and gardens; along with our general Public Happiness activities. \  \n \  \nHow much funding is raised will determine whether we tour in a bus or a fleet of vans and minibuses. The ideal bus would be a 1960's classic British Routemaster, due to the attention it would get outside of the UK boosting our marketing effort. The average price of these is £100,000+. A more likely choice is a Volvo B7TL Double Decker due to their renowned reliability.   \n  \nIf we go with van's a fleet of Mercedes Sprinters will join '[Connie the Connector](https://www.facebook.com/connietheconnector/)' again due to their reliability, and also Andy's experience in repairing them.  [Connie the Connector](https://www.facebook.com/connietheconnector/) was converted by Andy and another community member in 2014 to switch back and forth between regular Diesel and running on Waste Vegetable Oil - leftover cooking oil (WVO). As it is arguably still the greenest form of fuelling a vehicle, all other vehicles will also be converted, giving us the ability to collect from people joining our activities and project in each location, and/or to partner with a major restaurant or hotel chain and collect their left over oils. \  \n \  \n \  \n10.3. \  \n**Video Channel \  \n**The bus tour will be filmed, with regular instalments of life on the road taking Public Happiness and our token into local communities and bringing more happiness and well-being to the world. As a ground-breaking and exciting project we anticipate attracting a large following, especially as it will be supported by all other marketing efforts.  \n  \n10.4. \  \n**Happy Cam \  \n**The project's adopted dog rescue dog will be entering a life full of travel,  happy faces, and fun public events to enjoy. Not only will he/she become a superstar for the cameras, they will also become a video creator with a harness and Gopro mounted, so that viewers can tune in to our Youtube and watch clips of life travelling the world with a community in a bus/van fleet, and creating public happiness, from the perspective of a very happy dog.  \n  \n10.5 \  \n**Public Happiness Partners \  \n**There is already a small movement of active Public Happiness creators around the World, just waiting to spark into life, with many held back by the difficulties of balancing committing so much time towards increasing well-being for their community, against the pressures of needing to be paid for their work in today's world.  \  \n \  \nFounder Andy has been a Public Happiness Activist/Expert for the past 6 years and is connected to the most active of these. They will be offered 'back-pay' for their contributions towards creating a kinder world for us all to live in, and invited to join our platform and use the ecosystem to remove this financial pressure, and to massively increase their network effect. You can also read more details about this in section 5.4. \  \n \  \nNew groups operating for similar goals will be invited to join our ecosystem if they are comfortable operating within our [Community Values](https://news.focallocal.org/the-focallocal-community-values/), and massively boost their good work through our enhanced network effect while also retaining their collective identity.  \n  \nThe percentage earned from each sub-activity when coordinating large scale activities and projects is not subject to the usual weekly limits for tokens earned. \  \n  \n  \n10.6.** \  \nOnline Supporters  \  \n**An open (non-censored) community is active on Reddit at reddit.com/r/focallocal where people can interact with other supporters of the project, and our internal community will communicate through our Discourse forum at [discuss.focallocal.org](https://discuss.focallocal.org/)   \n  \n10.7.** \  \nContests \  \n**Everyone loves giveaways and a strategy of rewarding those most active in promoting our ICO and Token in a series of contest will be created \  \n  \n  \n10.8. \  \n**Collectables \  \n**Collectables will be created for special activities a user joins in, and also landmarks they achieve within our ecosystem. This acts as a fun side game within the platform while giving milestone rewards to users, and using it to introduce the them to collectables and other crypto-economic ideas. The collectables will be characters designed by the community and may feature logos, titles and names of the groups who coordinated large scale activities/projects.** \  \n**  \n  \nAutomated Token Distribution Matrix  \n  \n \  \nThe platform automates rewards for carrying out tasks via our ecosystem which work towards to maintaining and improving its operations, and the mission of creating greater more friendliness, peace and happiness in this world.   \n  \n11.1. \  \n**Weighted Mining \  \n** \  \nLevels of trust:** \  \n**Users will go up in ranks as their total contribution to global happiness increases through our our platform. Each rank receives more tokens for each action on the platform. To reduce the incentive for scamming by making it less rewarding to automate new accounts, and to reward the most active and loyal contributors to the Focallocal Token ecosystem and global happiness mission.  \n  \n** \  \n**Levels of Scale:** \  \n**Some local activities are organised on an International Scale as a coordinated effort to create positive cultural change. Peter Sharp at the Liberators International for example organises a yearly Eye Contact Gathering promoting increased human and societal connection through sharing a minutes eye contact with passers-by to remind us of their shared human experience beyond superficial differences such as age, gender, ethnicity, etc. Last year on one day he mobilised a gathering in over 350 cities around the world, bringing action to the streets for more connected communities at a local level while targeting a global increase in well-being.   \n  \nWhen an activity is tiered in this manner on our site over the course of a few days, the original organiser will receive 20% of the tokens awarded to all the Public Happiness Activities they led and supported. Their core team will also receive a larger share of tokens if they are using the Action Center in our ecosystem to incentivise building and publicising the project.  \n  \n[List of participating cities](https://www.eyecontactexperiment.com/participating-countries) for the 2017 International Eye Contact for Human Connection. \  \n  \n  \nLevels of average cost of living in each country:  \  \nThe token earnings from creating activities or completing project missions will be linked to the current average income in each country, keeping a balanced incentive to join the project across every nation. Taken from a publicly available online source of average cost of living per country.   \n  \nIn special occasions the community may choose to vote on increasing the incentive in a specific country above its cost of living, for example, to offer support during hyperinflation such as Venezuela has recently been experiencing; or perhaps to target a country where few people have joined (obviously this creates an avenue for potential voting abuse and will need to be monitored rigorously until the communities self-governance is mature and pressure tested). \  \n  \n  \n11.2.** \  \nHard Cap \  \n**A hard cap will be set on the amount that any one user can earn each payment period at each user level to minimise the risk from abuse and fraud, and to maintain our vision of Focallocal Token allowing users freedom to reduce their working hours and give time to resolving issues to create and maintain a happier, more connected local community. \  \n \  \nThe percentage earned from each sub-activity when coordinating large scale activities and projects is not subject to the usual weekly hard cap limits for tokens earned, although any obscenely large reward will likely be flagged for discussion by the community before being released. \  \n \  \n11.3. \  \n**Adjusting the Balancing**  \n  \nThe automated weighting and distribution system will apply a set level to the above metrics, which can be adjusted by community voting to find the most efficient balance for maximising our network effect and mirror its evolution.   \n  \n11.4. \  \n**Token Release** \  \nInitially a pre-set amount of tokens will be set to release each week for 100 years, divided between active contributors to the ecosystem and mission. The number of tokens released each week will be set on a graduated incline to balance rewarding early contributors with greater rewards, against the exponential increase of users the token will be divided amongst as the community grows. \  \n \  \nThis weekly token release makes our currency deflationary, which will be offset by increases in value from market trading. \  \n \  \n11.5. \  \n**Mining Table** \  \n \  \n[Provisional table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oufDho2f_jT12ch0ef6wC4yVWTLQClK2t0gxTTvv6fI/edit?usp=sharing) of actions contributing to the ecosystem which users are rewarded for \  \n \  \n11.6. \  \n**Experience Multipliers** \  \nA users total tokens earned/contribution to the ecosystem is recorded and used as a multiplier increasing their tokens earned and also the weight of their votes.  \n  \n  \n  \n*   Beginner Happiness Maker  \n*   Novice Well-being Creator  \n*   Experienced Positivity Activist  \n*   Local  Action Hero  \n*   Public Happiness Legend \  \n  \n  \n11.7.  \  \n**Token Distribution** \  \n50% (4.85 Billion Tokens) will be released during the initial 3 ICO launches and give the token value through trading on exchanges \  \n \  \n10% will be retained to pay for hiring experts to lead the development and marketing of the Token while the community grows its capacity to self-govern, promote and evolve. \  \n \  \n40% will be retained in our vault to be 'mined' by users incentivising public happiness and doing essential work in the ecosystem. \  \n \  \nInitial targeted release time: 100 years  \  \n \  \nThe mining total will include a small amount that will be 'back-paid' to notable communities around the world who have given their time to create Public Happiness projects which fit within our shared Mission, as a thank you for their efforts, and in order to encourage them to join the platform and use it to increase their network effect. This will also include volunteers who gave their time and energy to the Focallocal community, never expecting to be reimbursed. \  \n  \n  \n9.7 Billion \  \n50 % = 4.85b \  \n40% = 3.88b \  \n100 year = 36500 Days \  \nAverage release rate: 265753/day** \  \n \  \n**Release rate will be curved to keep the excitement of getting in early, while not making the tokens worthless when users join in later.  \  \n \  \n11.8. \  \n**Further Matrix Considerations \  \n** \  \nThe matrix needs to consider:  \  \nThe number of active users each week, from 10 to 100,000 to 100,000,000 \  \nThe number of actions per week by a user, plotted between 1, to a high of 400. With the average per user anticipated to be around 20, multiplied by the users experience rating. \  \n \  \nIn charts assessing reward rates tokens should be plotted against different market caps from £10,000 to £100,000,000,000 to show anticipated value of incentive for contributing to our token in Ethereum, Bitcoin, £, $ and E.  \  \n \  \nThe returns are speculative at this point, and we will adjust the points 'mined' for each action as the platform launches to find a nice balance. As the governance progresses on the path to decentralisation, these charts will be interactive and hosted on the platform as a useful visual guide during votes on increasing/decreasing these data points to balance their impact in advancing and maintaining the mission.  \n  \nTeam** **  \n  \nSome roles will be fixed for increased stability and an initial injection of experience and necessary skills. Others will be outsourced to the community via Microvolunteering in the Action Center   \n  \n12.1.** \  \nCurrent Team Members**  \n  \nAndy Tulett: Community and Token Founder \  \nPublic Happiness Expert/Activist since 2012 \  \nDegree in Business and Entrepreneurship from University of Portsmouth \  \n  \n  \n12.2. \  \n**Positions Open**  \n  \n  \n  \n*   Marketing Team  \n*   Automated Token Distribution Systems Engineer/Data Scientists  \n*   Behavioural Analyst  \n*   Community Managers  \n*   Road Trip Coordinator  \n*   ERC20 Experienced Developer to work on integration  \n*   Crypto/Blockchain Expert to work on integrating on-ramp into our platform guiding users to an base understanding of crypto economics   \n*   PR Manager  \n*   Meteor/JavaScript Developers  \n*   API Key Integration Specialist  \n*   Digital Security Expert  \n*   Accounts and Finances Manager  \n*   Youtube/Video Channel Manager  \n*   Crypto/Securities Legal Expert to ensure our token makes every effort to meet all required national and regional laws  \n*   Release Manager  \n  \nRoles will be for a pre-agreed period to invigorate and lead the community as it grows. Once the community reaches maturation all of the above roles will be governed by decentralised members of the community itself who will be rewarded by tokens to an amount the community has agreed on – although hopefully the experts will choose to remain actively involved in the community they were integral in building, due to their previous contributions they will have earned top level user status.** \  \n **  \n  \n12.3. \  \n**Remuneration \  \n**The team of experts will be remunerated 50% in Ethereum, and 50% in Focallocal Tokens with the 1<sup>st</sup> payments coming shortly after the ICO launch and including all work towards the project prior to the ICO .  \n  \n \  \n12.4.** \  \nFacilities \  \n**The team will either operate remotely using our online hub, or work from the road trip which travels to demonstrate to communities how they can use our platform to improve life where they live, aiming to attract new members to the platform and form groups in each location using our ecosystem to work on improving life quality where they live (see Marketing in section 10.2. for more details about the road trip).  \  \n \  \nNot requiring fixed office space will enable us to keep overheads low, adding flexibility and the ability to weather crisis, alongside a sense of adventure matching our global ambitions, to the project.  \n  \nTechnicals  \n  \n13.1.** \  \nCrypto Linking Bridges**  \n  \nPublic Happiness Activities: Meteor Js/React to REST API   \n  \nWell-being Projects (Missions): Web-hooks from Trello (or Wekan)  \n  \n13.2. \  \n**Trello vs Wekan vs Other Solutions**  \n  \nThe Public Happiness projects section in the Action Center is a Micro-volunteering Hub which breaks large projects down into 30 min – 1 hour 'Missions', enabling anyone to join in and help build the project and bring it into the world.  \n  \n \  \nCurrently the system uses Trello as an external platform. This creates a vulnerability where malicious users can damage altruistic projects by moving cards around, or deleting them. As the user-base grows we have scheduled a switch to Wekan, an open-source clone where we can import all of our data, although the community may decide to go in a completely different direction to improve project management on our platform. \  \n \  \n** \  \n**13.3. \  \n**Leaflet.js vs Google Maps API  \  \n**The Public Happiness Gatherings system is currently build using MeteorJS, React and [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/). The map itself is designed by members of our previous (non-incentivised) volunteer community and pulled from Google's API. The Public Happiness Gatherings system can handle 25,000 users each day, giving us a lot of room to develop before we need to assess changes.  \n  \n13.4.** \  \nSwitching the Platform to the Dapps Network  \  \n(Decentralised App)**  \n  \nThe two main areas of our platform, the Map (Public Happiness Gatherings) and the Projects/Micro-volunteering (Missions) are built in Meteor Js* which is ideal for switching to host on Ethereum's Dapp network as it is built using reactive programming. \  \n \  \nThis switch is not guaranteed at this point, but it is a logical step and will be reviewed by the team and community at predetermined steps during the roadmap.  \n  \nDoomsday Protocol  \n  \n \  \nThe Crypto world is highly volatile at this point in time which will lead many projects to overstretch themselves, ending up in trouble if an event outside of their control hits. \  \n \  \n14.1. \  \n**Huge Market Crash \  \n**Focallocal Token is entirely secure from some major news crashing investors confidence in the entire blockchain market. Everything is designed with the ability to fall away, with the platform and community capable of running a skeleton site with near zero outgoings. \  \n \  \nWe achieve this important safety buffer by transferring agreed fees and payments into a separate bank account and crypto wallets immediately upon agreeing an outgoing and preferring short term contracts as a policy, because the ecosystem will be self-sustaining in the future without needing external contracts; meaning all future costs are safely stored away and ready to be paid when agreed. The platform could in theory continue operating with absolutely zero outgoings if we collectively decide to switch to running on the Dapps network. \  \n \  \nThe project already has 6 years of experience demonstrating that people believe in our vision and will continue to use the platform regardless of the value of the Token. Even in the case of a complete market crash where the token became almost worthless for a prolonged period, many users would remain active supporting the mission, and using the platform to deliver greater peace and well-being to the world.  \  \n \  \nFocallocal Token would basically become fancy internet points, with the added benefit that the loyal members, and those giving their time and energy to global happiness purely for altruistic reasons would get to stock up on token and be handsomely rewarded when it rises from the embers of the market crash.   \n  \nAs long as there is a community behind it the Token cannot fail, it will continue to be a positive force in this world regardless of Market conditions. \  \n \  \n \  \n14.2. \  \n**Quantum Security \  \n**To some extent we are tied to advancements in the Ethereum network. There are open pull requests such as pull request #208: Abstraction of transaction origin and signature.md.  \  \n \  \nOn our end our entire system is being reviewed by a quantum security experts, and we will also host bounties and bounty hunting contests for anyone able to find flaws and vulnerabilities in our platform so they can be identified and fixed.  \n  \n14.3. \  \n**Massive Hack** \  \nAs a last resort in the case of a massive attack there is the possibility of a Hard Fork, resetting everything to a time before the hack on the public ledger.  \n  \nOur Tokens value is tied to its positive effect on wider society, raising the possibility of a hard fork at a set point before the hack switching the token used on the platform; isolated from its ability to create societal good the original would become worthless.  \n  \nAll data of tokens earned on the system is held off-site in social media and gathered by our bots, or in provable work contributed by users in the Action Center, Community News Site and Forums. It would be a large task, but all tokens mined fairly between the time of the hack and the fork could be restored. Traded Tokens (outside of lost in the hack) would be visible on the public ledger and proof of ownership could be submitted to gain the new Token.  \  \n \  \nProject contributions in Wekan/Trello can be backed up off-site or recovered from the teams which created the projects. Token earned legitimately after the hack could easily be restored, leaving the thieves with worthless digital residue.  \  \n \  \nThe implications of this option are obviously wide ranging and it would be an absolute last resort in a disaster mitigation strategy, with the case explained to the community before being voted on.  \n  \n14.4.** \  \nZombie Apocalypse ** \  \nIf the inevitable finally occurs, we will convert the Public Happiness Bus into a 'Public Happiness Buoat' and retreat to a small uninhabited Greek island, where our new society will flourish and sparkle as a bastion to all Humanity's greatest achievements by using Focallocal Token to create a paradise where every economic interaction creates more harmony and a closer more caring community, while the rest of the world performs a perfect impression of today's paparazzi for each others brains.  \  \n \  \nIf the community has decided on having a fixed base, for example renovating an abandoned village, before this point it will built using the best off-grid technology today's society has to offer, and be zombie-proofed.  \n  \nGiving Back to Open-source  \n  \n \  \n2% of all funds we raise from the ICO will be donated to support the Open-source ecosystem that drives so much of the innovation we see in the world \  \n \  \n15.1. \  \n**Open Source Projects We Use \  \n**2% will be donated to the following projects we've used in creating our platform, Token, and Movement;  \n  \n  \n  \n*   Discourse  \n*   Vue.js  \n*   Wekan?  \n*   Libre Office  \n*   Free Wordpress Plugins  \n  \n15.2. \  \n**Donations to Notable Other Open-source Projects**  \n  \n1% will be donated to other notable open-source projects which are positive forces within this world, as chosen by our community through voting, for example, Wikipedia.   \  \n \  \nThe vote results will be non-binding, to mitigate against any obvious attempts to cheat the vote by outside groups as the platform and community will not yet be ready to protect itself from coordinated efforts to cheat the vote, without spending an unnecessary amount of energy on securing the voting (it can be used as an early pressure test on the integrity of certain areas of the platform as this type of online contest invariably draws efforts to undermine fair voting).  \n  \nTimeline  \n  \nAgreed Date  \n  \n  \n  \n*   30/7/2018 : 1st draft of the White Paper  \n*      : 2nd draft of the White Paper  \n*      : Witticism, fun and Focallocally flavour added to white paper  \n*      : Technical Details focused heavily around the Distribution Matrix added to the white paper  \n*      : Provisional White Paper posted online to announce our token, and gather feedback for further improvements, and build team. ICO Launch date planned  \n  \nStill to plan:  \n  \n  \n  \n*   ICO Launch Date Announced  \n*   1<sup>st</sup> Stage ICO  \n*   2<sup>nd</sup> Stage ICO  \n*   3<sup>rd</sup> Stage ICO  \n*   Apps launched  \n*   Multi Language adaptation pushed to the entire site  \n*   Open-source map replaces Google based map (if required)  \n*   Add blockchain terminology into our platform to on-ramp users to a better understanding of blockchain and crypto economics, to fulfil our mission of taking crypto to people on the streets.  \n  \nQuestions for the Community to Resolve  \n  \n  \n  \n*   Is the name correct?  \n    *   Focallocal Token, to represent its local targeted action and be clearly based on the 6 years of previous action.   \n    *   Or Public Happiness Token, to use a more self-explanatory name?  \n*   Open-source vs Closed Code Base \  \nAdded security risks from allowing hackers to search for vulnerabilities, vs the crypto communities strong preference for open source projects  \n*   Getting listed on centralised and decentralised exchanges. The token will have no value if people can't trade it so we'll need to be listed on a few before the ICO finishes  \n*   Which other crypto coins/tokens should we include in the platform to introduce our users into the crypto-economic ecosystem, for example, should our videos primarily be  hosted on Lbury? Is their platform ready?  \n*   Should the platform be hosted on the DAPP network?  \n*   Should community governance voting be tokenized/on-chain? Or using our Discourse forum's voting? Security might be better is on-chain  \n*   How can we best compartmentalise voting to prevent overload on users, without pockets of influence forming?   \n  \n    <span style='text-decoration:underline;'>Next Steps</span>  \n  \n*   Set up ICO plan within our Action Center  \n*   Full review of all content on focallocal.org to update content that has become outdated  \n*   Token created  \n*   Full security review of all open-source plugins used in building the website  \n*   Full review of platform UX/UI and tech stack, looking quick ways to make large usability improvements, improving access and scalability.  \n  \n    Thank you for reading, have a wonderful day!  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n");//"# Welcome to the 1st Draft"
